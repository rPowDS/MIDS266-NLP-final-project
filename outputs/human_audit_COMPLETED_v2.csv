8565,"A man caught on film by surveillance cameras allegedly hitting his three-year-old toddler in the face at a supermarket was arrested on Friday. KERO-TV reports 23-year-old Justin Whittington of Bakersfield, California was taken into custody on Thursday night on suspicion of child endangerment after the video of the alleged abuse surfaced online. The relationship between the toddler and Whittington has not yet been revealed by police but the owner of Vest Market Harry Dindral said the man was the boy's father and said that he's seen them in the store together before. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . The punch: Surveillance video shows a man chasing a toddler then hitting him in the face . The video posted to social media and shared thousands of times shows a boy running through Vest Market. The toddler is approached by a man believed to be his father who hits him in the face. The man then is then shown aggressively yanking up the toddler by his shirt. A pregnant woman, can be seen coming and taking the distraught boy away. The child appears to leave the store crying and covering his face. The police were notified of the video after it was leaked online. They asked the public for help identifying the man in the video who ruthlessly punched the small child. By midnight, the man who was caught on video punching the toddler, 23-year-old Justin Whittington, was in police custody. The Kern County Jail website showed Whittington remained behind bars on Friday with bail set at $1 million. 'That was horrible, man,' owner of Vest Market Harry Dindral told the Daily News. Horrifying: Video shows the injured boy crying on the floor, then the man who may his father, yanking him up off the ground by his shirt . 'The worst thing I've ever seen,' he said of the incident at his establishment. Dindral says he was in the back of the store when his employee ran to him and told him to watch the surveillance video to see if there was any proof of the violent assault. Dindral later gave the footage to cops who were able to track down the suspect. 'It was the right thing to do,' Dindral told the Daily News. 'You don’t hit a child like that.' Local Tattoo artist Chris Danaher who works near the market said he could never fathom acting violently towards a child. 'I would never imagine treating a child like that,' Danaher told ABC. 'His wife or girlfriend or whatever was clearly pregnant. She had no regard to it. She picked up her son and left the store,' he added. Danher said sadly the child is too young to truly understand what is going on. 'It's terrible. That kid is obviously too young to know what was going on. Honestly, couldn't be more than 3 years old, and I just couldn't imagine anyone doing that to me or me doing that to a child whatsoever,' said Danaher. The boy was later examined by medical personnel at his home and he did not require hospitalization. It is unknown whether or not he will be placed in new custody. A second video released on Friday shows Whittington allegedly picking up his son like a rag doll. The potential child abuse case is currently under investigation.","Justin Whittington, 23, of Bakersfield, California was taken into custody on Thursday night on suspicion of child endangerment after the video of the alleged abuse surfaced online .

2241,"Gary Mabbutt has spoken for the first time about how he was left with a 30 inch scar following a five hour operation to save his leg. The ex-Tottenham and England star, 53, was rushed to hospital after waking up at 1am to find that the leg had gone cold back in 2013. Mabbutt's diabetes had led to a clogged artery in the limb and doctors warned him it was 'touch and go' on whether it would have to be amputated. Gary Mabbutt has been left with a 30inch scar on his left leg after his diabetes caused an artery to be clogged . He was treated at King's College Hospital in south east London, undergoing an emergency five-hour operation. Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal the horrific wound. Mabbutt, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 17, will not be able to play football again, leaving his dream of becoming a manager in tatters. As he is unable to train with players on the pitch, he has been forced to turn down roles in coaching. Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal it . The Spurs legend has spoken for the first time about the agony he went through and says he hopes to raise awareness of his condition. Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'When they talked about battling to save my leg, I realised I was helpless. As a diabetic you know complications can occur. But you think ""It's never going to happen to me"". It is vital to educate everyone with diabetes how to take care of themselves. If you have anything unusual with your feet, tingly toes, blisters, see your doctor.' In 1982, father-of-two Mabbutt became the first diabetic ever to play for England and captained Tottenham to FA cup glory in 1991. Former star: Mabbutt is pictured, left, lifting the FA Cup while playing for Tottenham in  1991 . He was unaware that his diabetes had triggered peripheral arterial disease, clogging up the blood vessels in the legs. Every year, surgeons perform around 8,000 amputations on diabetics in the UK - but campaigners say four out five could be prevented. Amputations cost the NHS £650million a year - and up 80 per cent of the amputees die within five years. Diabates sufferers are entitled to annual eye tests as they are are 20 times more likely to develop sight problems, but Gary Mabbutt wants a similar programme to apply to feet. Experts say millions of diabetics are unaware their condition could lead to foot problems and agree regular checks could save limbs.","Gary Mabbutt was rushed to hospital after waking up at 1am to find his leg had gone cold back in 2013 .

5306,"A small 'hot spot' in the U.S. Southwest is responsible for producing the largest concentration of the greenhouse gas methane seen over the United States - and is the subject of a major new investigation to find out why. The hot spot, near the Four Corners intersection of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, covers only about 2,500 square miles (6,500 square kilometers), or half the size of Connecticut. A recent Nasa map shows is produces more than triple the standard ground-based estimate - and researchers say they don't know why.. Scroll down for video . The Four Corners area (red) is the major U.S. hot spot for methane emissions in this map showing how much emissions varied from average background concentrations from 2003-2009 (dark colors are lower than average; lighter colors are higher). The hot spot, near the Four Corners intersection of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, covers only about 2,500 square miles. Methane is very efficient at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Like carbon dioxide, it contributes to global warming. To calculate the emissions rate that would be required to produce the observed concentration of methane in the air, the authors performed high-resolution regional simulations using a chemical transport model, which simulates how weather moves and changes airborne chemical compounds. Researchers from several institutions are now in the Four Corners region of the U.S. Southwest with a suite of airborne and ground-based instruments, aiming to uncover reasons for a mysterious methane 'hot spot' detected from space. 'With all the ground-based and airborne resources that the different groups are bringing to the region, we have the unique chance to unequivocally solve the Four Corners mystery,' said Christian Frankenberg, a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, who is heading NASA's part of the effort. Other investigators are from the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) in Boulder, Colorado; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Last fall, researchers including Frankenberg reported that a small region around the Four Corners intersection of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah had the highest concentration of methane over background levels of any part of the United States. An instrument on a European Space Agency satellite measuring greenhouse gases showed a persistent atmospheric hot spot in the area between 2003 and 2009. The amount of methane observed by the satellite was much higher than previously estimated. The satellite observations were not detailed enough to reveal the actual sources of the methane in the Four Corners. Likely candidates include venting from oil and gas activities, which are primarily coalbed methane exploration and extraction in this region; active coal mines; and natural gas seeps. Researchers from CIRES, NOAA's Earth Systems Research Laboratory and Michigan are conducting a field campaign called TOPDOWN (Twin Otter Projects Defining Oil Well and Natural gas emissions) 2015, bringing airborne and ground-based instruments to investigate possible sources of the methane hot spot. Shiprock, New Mexico, is in the Four Corners region where an atmospheric methane ""hot spot"" can be seen from space. Researchers are currently in the area, trying to uncover the reasons for the hot spot. The JPL team will join the effort on April 17 and fly two complementary remote sensing instruments on two Twin Otter research aircraft. The Next-Generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRISng), which observes spectra of reflected sunlight, flies at a higher altitude and will be used to map methane at fine resolution over the entire region. Using this information and ground measurements from the other research teams, the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) will fly over suspected methane sources, making additional, highly sensitive measurements of methane. Depending on its flight altitude, the NASA aircraft can image methane features with a spatial resolution better than three feet (one meter) square. In other words, it can create a mosaic showing how methane levels vary every few feet, enabling the identification of individual sources. Hotspot of total column methane anomalies centered over the Four Corners region from 2003 to 2009, when a satellite-based methane-measuring instrument was operational. The April study will focus on verifying the hotspot and determining the methane sources producing the exceptionally elevated methane concentrations. With the combined resources, the investigators hope to quantify the region's overall methane emissions and pinpoint contributions from different sources. They will track changes over the course of the month-long effort and study how meteorology transports emissions through the region. 'If we can verify the methane detected by the satellite and identify its sources, decision-makers will have critical information for any actions they are considering,' said CIRES scientist Gabrielle Pétron, one of the mission's investigators. Part of President Obama's recent Climate Action Plan calls for reductions in methane emissions. The research team also includes scientists from the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado, Boulder; the U.S. Bureau of Land Management; and the state of New Mexico. Is this the cause? The Four Corners coal-fired power plant, near Farmington, is one of the targets Nasa wants to investigate as a possible cause of the methane . In each of the seven years studied from 2003-2009, the area released about 0.59 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere. This is almost 3.5 times the estimate for the same area in the European Union's widely used Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. In the study published online today in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, researchers used observations made by the European Space Agency's Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) instrument, which measured greenhouse gases from 2002 to 2012. The atmospheric hot spot persisted throughout the study period. A ground station in the Total Carbon Column Observing Network, operated by the Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory, provided independent validation of the measurement. To calculate the emissions rate that would be required to produce the observed concentration of methane in the air, the authors performed high-resolution regional simulations using a chemical transport model, which simulates how weather moves and changes airborne chemical compounds. Research scientist Christian Frankenberg of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, first noticed the Four Corners signal years ago in SCIAMACHY data. 'We didn't focus on it because we weren't sure if it was a true signal or an instrument error,' Frankenberg said. The study's lead author, Eric Kort of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, noted the study period predates the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, near the hot spot. This indicates the methane emissions should not be attributed to fracking but instead to leaks in natural gas production and processing equipment in New Mexico's San Juan Basin, which is the most active coalbed methane production area in the country. Natural gas is 95-98 percent methane. Methane is colorless and odorless, making leaks hard to detect without scientific instruments. 'The results are indicative that emissions from established fossil fuel harvesting techniques are greater than inventoried,' Kort said. 'There's been so much attention on high-volume hydraulic fracturing, but we need to consider the industry as a whole.' In just one place in the United States do four states meet. The borders of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona intersect at Four Corners, west of the confluence of the Mancos and San Juan Rivers. Coalbed methane is gas that lines pores and cracks within coal. In underground coal mines, it is a deadly hazard that causes fatal explosions almost every year as it seeps out of the rock. After the U.S. energy crisis of the 1970s, techniques were invented to extract the methane from the coal and use it for fuel. By 2012, coalbed methane supplied about 8 percent of all natural gas in the United States. Frankenberg noted that the study demonstrates the unique role space-based measurements can play in monitoring greenhouse gases. 'Satellite data cannot be as accurate as ground-based estimates, but from space, there are no hiding places,' Frankenberg said. In March 2014 the Obama Administration announced a strategy to reduce methane emissions under its Climate Action Plan. The strategy includes improving the measurement and monitoring of methane emissions and assessing current methane emissions data.","A small 'hot spot' in the U.S. Southwest is responsible for producing the largest concentration of the greenhouse gas methane seen over the United States - and is the subject of a major new investigation to find out why .

A former pupil of Methodist College Belfast, his peers included Luke Marshall, Craig Gilroy and Paddy Jackson who also joined Ulster's Academy straight from school. Ulster back Michael Allen (left) will be joining Edinburgh at the end of the season on a two-year deal . But Allen admits his move from Belfast to the Scottish capital will take him out of his comfort zone. He said: 'I've never lived anywhere else, always been in Belfast, and I'm probably a bit of a homebird. I do love the city and everything that comes with it but I'm looking forward to making a change, starting afresh. 'Apart from playing Edinburgh at BT Murrayfield over the last few years, I've only ever to been to the city twice to visit, both times with rugby school tours when we played Merchiston Castle School. 'I'm really looking forward to moving to the city, I'm really excited. It looks like an incredible place to live.' What has also excited Allen is the progress of Edinburgh this season and the style of play developing within the club. He said: 'Edinburgh have played some brilliant rugby this year and shown the potential of being a very, very good side. 'I think the ethos, the fitness, the physicality, everything - from what I can see the team pride themselves on being the best defensively, the fittest and the most disciplined and I'm just looking forward to getting stuck in and trying to spring anything I can.' 24-year-old Allen (centre), who has never lived outside of Ireland, can either play at wing or centre .","Ulster back Michael Allen will join the club at the end of the season .

9986,"Christian refugees have revealed how they linked arms to form a 'human chain' in a desperate bid to stop Muslim migrants throwing them into the sea after an argument about religion. A group of 15 men were arrested on suspicion of 'multiple aggravated murder motivated by religious hate'.last week after 12 Christians from Ghana and Nigeria were allegedly thrown off a rubber dinghy into the Mediterranean Sea. Survivors from the boat, made up of 105 migrants from diverse religions and ethnicities, have now claimed the men tried to throw other Christians off the side of the vessel after an argument about religion - but were prevented because they huddled together to create a human chain. Scroll down for video . A Christian migrant told how he and others formed a 'human chain' to stop Muslim men who were allegedly trying to throw them overboard. Pictured: A migrant looks on after disembarking from a tug boat in Trapani . Fifteen men were arrested on suspicion of 'multiple aggravated murder motivated by religious hate'.last week after 12 Christian men from Ghana and Nigeria were allegedly thrown into the Mediterranean Sea . Yeboah, from Ghana, told police in Palmero that he boarded a dinghy in Libya heading to Sicily last Saturday and said the men threw three of his friends and six others into the water. He said: ‘About a day and a half into the crossing, at a certain point some Muslims started to rail against us Christians just because we practiced a different religion. 'Many said that they should throw us into the sea. After the threats we found ourselves in open sea and not long after they started to throw some Christians in the sea.’ He added: 'They tried to throw me and the other Christians still on board as well but they didn't manage to because we held onto the boat and clung onto each other', according to Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. 'We resisted for an hour and only stopped when the rescue boat arrived.’ Another survivor Augustin told the newspaper that one of the alleged killers was bitten on his foot by one of the people he had thrown overboard, which helped police identify him. He said: ‘On Sunday evening spontaneously, the people that spoke French began to rage against the Ghanaians and the Nigerians. The men were allegedly killed more than a day into the journey, when an argument started about religion. Pictured: Migrants are transferred to holding centres after landing in Augusta's port, near Siracusa, Sicily . 'I don’t know why maybe because there were too many of us on board. One of us understood what they were saying that they wanted to throw us into the sea. 'Soon afterwards they threw three Nigerians and six Ghanaians into the sea, after desperate attempts by each one not to be thrown overboard.' Augustin added that each victim was beaten first, and that he saw each one drown because every time someone was thrown overboard the driver stopped the dingy. The 15 migrants arrested over the attack on their arrival in Palermo are from the Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali and Guinea Bissau. The police statement said their motive for the attack was that the victims 'professed the Christian faith while the aggressors were Muslim.' The revelation about last week's incident follows news than more than 700 migrants are feared dead after a boat heading for Malta sank in the Mediterranean this weekend. A rescue operation coordinated by the Italian coast guard involving 18 ships is still underway in the hopes of rescuing more people from the midnight sinking off the Libyan coast, 120 miles south of the Italian island of Lampedusa.","15 men arrested on suspicion of 'multiple aggravated murder motivated by religious hate'

The image has since gone viral . Unapologetic: Elisha Wilson Beach posted the image alongside a series of hashtags to explain her reasons for posting the image including #confessionsofamom, #ididthat and #iamnotsorry . Debate: The image, which has attracted more than 25,000 shares on Facebook has provoked debate . Alongside the image are the words: 'This is motherhood and it ain't always pretty. What's your #momtruth? #motherhood #motherhoodaintpretty #tmi #confessionsofamom #ididthat #iamnotsorry' The snap has divided the internet community with much of the online furore focused around hygiene. One Facebook user, Amanda Martin, wrote: 'I would never ever breastfeed my child in the bathroom. It's unsanitary regardless. 'Stick your kid in the crib until you're done, or pump it and give it to them.' Another, Karen Bryce, chimed in: 'How can you say this picture is beautiful? I think its very distasteful. 'Would you allow your partner to take a picture of you while doing the toilet? And then post it for all to see?' On Twitter, the image has also been doing the rounds with one user,@SeanKessie, saying: 'So disgusting, see photo of a mother breastfeeding her child while using the toilet.' While another, @WillTwerk4Food, expressed their dismay at the whole scene saying: 'It's the breastfeeding...the tampons on the floor...her being on the toilet...just everything.' Wilson Beach is the wife of TV actor Michael Beach, best known for his roles on Third Watch, Sons of Anarchy and ER . Divisive: Many people took to Twitter to voice their opinions on the image including @SeanKessie, who called the shot 'disgusting' This user, @WillTwerk4Food, complains about the general disarray of the bathroom as well as the nursing . There were also plenty of comments suggesting that Wilson Beach wasn't actually breastfeeding and that it was her elbow in the shot, something which the mother herself quickly cleared up. Posting her own riposte to the criticism on Facebook, she said: 'This is my picture and yes I am breastfeeding. 'I shared it on Instagram knowing that some people would think it's TMI but it's reality. Wilson Beach, who describes herself on Instagram as 'a mom, wife, arts educator, foodie, nauralista and more' adds: 'Everybody complains that social media is full of people pretending to live picture perfect lives and I see so many mothers doubting themselves based on those photos. She continued: 'Well, this is reality and so many mothers are doing this exact thing right now. Motherhood ain't pretty but then that's what makes it so beautiful.' The overwhelming reaction has been supportive though with many praising Wilson Beach's honesty for showing how demanding life can be with a young child. In 2014, students at the University of North Texas created When Nurture Calls campaign encouraging mothers not to retreat to the bathroom when nursing their children . On Facebook, Katrina L Pleasant-Wheatley wrote: 'This pretty much sums up mommyhood', while another user, Alicia Ringsaker, added: 'To the people calling this unsanitary or gross, most people brush their teeth in the bathroom and leave their toothbrushes in the bathroom. 'How is this gross and not that? Breasts are way more sanitary in the bathroom than your toothbrushes.' There was also love for Wilson Beach on Twitter, with ‏@joytammy writing: 'What is wrong with this photo? This beautiful mother was pictured breastfeeding her baby in the toilet.' Last year, a powerful ad campaign showed women nursing their babies in toilets in a bid to persuade people that women shouldn't be shamed into retreating into public bathrooms to breastfeed. The When Nurture Calls campaign was launched to show 'mothers who have been harassed to the point where they feel they have no other option but to nurture their baby in the restroom as to not offend anyone.' It pointed out that 'a baby should never be nurtured where nature calls.'","Mother-of-two Elisha Wilson Beach, from Los Angeles, posted the image on Instagram .

7289,"Excrement thrown at the statue of British colonialist Cecil John Rhodes has triggered a wave of protests across South Africa against 'racist' historical figures. Memorials to South Africa's colonial past were defaced by mainly young black protesters as statues of British monarchs Queen Victoria and King George V were splashed with paint in the cities of Port Elizabeth and Durban respectively. Vandals poured paint over Scottish-South African missionary Andrew Murray's statue in the Western Cape. War memorials were also defaced. A bronze rider marking the Anglo-Boer War from 1899 to 1902, was toppled from his horse. Object of anger: This statue of Queen Victoria outside the Port Elizabeth city library in South Africa is among a number of memorials to British colonials that have been vandalised during protests against 'racist' figures . A statue of a British soldier lays on the ground after being broken off its base in Port Elizabeth, South Africa . The defaced statue of British mining magnate and politician, Cecil John Rhodes, is lifted by a crane, from its position at the University of Cape Town (left), while (right) a chair marks the spot on the plinth where the decades old bronze statue stood before it was vandalised . In the latest demonstration, vandals smeared paint the figure of a young Mohandas Gandhi. Standing in the square in downtown Johannesburg named for Mahatma Gandhi, the memorial marks the Indian anti-colonial leader's time in South Africa, where he formulated the principle of passive resistance. The protester, who smudged white paint on Gandhi's cloak, accused him of being racist during his time in the country. Founding fathers of Afrikaner nationalism were also targeted. In Pretoria, the memorial of 19th century Afrikaner leader Paul Kruger was twice daubed with bright green paint, while the statue of Marthinus Pretorius, who founded the capital city, was splashed with reddish brown paint, according to local media reports. The statue of Louis Botha, the president of the South African Union in the early 1900s, was smeared with red and blue paint outside parliament in Cape Town on the same day that the Rhodes sculpture was removed from its perch overlooking the University of Cape Town after weeks of student protest. In the Free State province, a statue of Boer General Jan Fick was splashed with red paint in the town named after him in 1883, Ficksburg. Another statue is cleaned down after being splashed with green paint on Pretoria's Church Square . Security guards (left) walk past a statue of former South African statesman and Afrikaner leader Louis Botha, which has been defaced with red paint outside the South African parliament building in Cape Town . Several people have been arrested and local authorities have spent thousands of dollars cleaning up the statues. The opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, has come out in support of its members who have claimed responsibility for these acts of vandalism. It comes days after white solidarity groups held protests over the removal of a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes from the University of Cape Town after it was daubed with excrement. Members of the university council ordered that the bronze sculpture be removed after hearing its presence made black students feel uncomfortable and was seen a symbol of historical white oppression. The defaced statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes is tied by straps to a crane before its removal at the University of Cape Town. It follows weeks of protests at the university over the symbolism of the statue . The monument has been vandalised in recent weeks. It has not yet been decided where it will be moved . The government backed the move, with Sandile Memela, the spokesman for the arts and culture ministry, saying they are working to see if the country can take an 'official position' on statues and other colonial symbols. 'It marks a significant... shift where the country deals with its ugly past in a positive and constructive way', he said to press agency AFP, adding the government did not encourage the violent removal of statues. But the decision to move the monument of Rhodes – a 19th century imperialist who critics say helped pave the way for apartheid – has sparked protests in itself. The youth wing of white Afrikaner solidarity group AfriForum handed a memorandum to parliament in Cape Town to 'demand protection' for their heritage. The same statue was covered in plastic bags after protests by students and staff at the university in March . The university's council heard that black students felt uncomfortable because of the bronze monument . Politician and businessman Cecil Rhodes is called a 'racist' by his opponents. Born in 1853, he made his fortune in diamond mines, and entered into politics as an outspoken supporter of colonialism. He later founded Rhodesia - modern-day Zimbabwe - which was named after him. He believed England was the 'master race', and wanted to draw a 'red line' railway from Cairo to Cape Town for the British Empire - spanning the entire continent of Africa. While his supporters say he brought political and physical infrastructure to South Africa, others say his actions laid the groundwork for apartheid by restricting the rights of black Africans to work. While they are not recognised as supporters of Rhodes, statues of their heroes have been attacked during the university protests. A monument of former president Paul Kruger was splattered with paint, and Afrikaner men, some of them in quasi-military outfits, demonstrated next to it on Wednesday. 'The Afrikaner is -- from a historical perspective -- increasingly being portrayed as criminals and land thieves,' solidary group Afriforum said in a statement. 'If the heritage of the Afrikaner is not important to Government, our youth members will preserve our own heritage.' It has not been decided where the statue of Rhodes will end up, although it will likely be held in a museum.

2761,"West Ham striker Diafra Sakho is out for the remainder of the season after tearing a thigh muscle on Saturday against Stoke City. The 25-year-old is West Ham's runaway top scorer this season with 12 goals and was forced off after 59 minutes during their 1-1 draw at home. West Ham claimed Sakho could return 'before the end of the season' on their official website, but it appears unlikely the Senegal international will be fit enough to feature before the next campaign. West Ham striker Diafra Sakho limps off against Stoke City after 59 minutes to be replaced by Carlton Cole . The West Ham striker has scored 12 goals this season but is set to miss the rest of the campaign . Ten of Sakho's 12 goals came in the Barclays Premier League, with Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing the club's next top scorers with just five apiece. It comes as a blow for manager Sam Allardyce who is aiming to finish in eighth position as he fights for a new contract with West Ham. Allardyce's current deal expires at the end of the season and it is not certain co-owners David Gold and David Sullivan will keep him on, despite already beating last season's total by three points.

3353,"England are set to face trial by leg-spin after West Indies captain Denesh Ramdin confirmed Devendra Bishoo will play in Tuesday's second Test. Wrist spin has long been a bete noire for England batsmen, a quirk that has been passed down the DNA since Australia's Shane Warne dominated the old enemy for more than a decade. Peter Moores' current side, with the fresh faces of Gary Ballance, Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali and Jos Buttler throughout the order, have yet to face a frontline leg-spinner in Tests but that will change when Bishoo returns at the National Stadium in Grenada. West Indies cricketer Devendra Bishoo will play against England in the second Test . West Indies captain Denesh Ramdin confirmed that leg-spinner Bishoo will play on Tuesday . His record over 11 caps is modest, with 40 wickets at 39.55, but the 29-year-old comes into the game in place of the dropped Sulieman Benn in superb form. His last five first-class matches for Guyana have yielded a phenomenal 37 wickets with six wicket hauls against Barbados, Trinidad & Tobago and the Windward Islands. 'Bishoo will be in,' said Ramdin, when asked about his bowling line-up. West Indies  captain Ramdin prepares for the second Test in the nets . 'The pitch will turn out to be better - in terms of spin - than the first Test in Antigua. He has bowled really well in first-class cricket in the last month and a half. 'In our squad's practice match he bowled long spells and got results. 'It's going to be a batting track for the first two days and then the fourth and five days, the spinner will come into play.

10542,"Hillary Clinton's family's charities are refiling at least five years of tax returns after an investigation revealed they had misreported tens of millions of dollars in donations from governments. The charities' errors generally took the form of under-reporting or over-reporting donations from foreign governments, or in other instances, omitted to break out government donations entirely when reporting revenue, the charities confirmed to Reuters, which uncovered the mistakes. Following the discovery, the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative said they will be refiling multiple annual tax returns and may audit returns extending as far back as 15 years in case there have been other errors. The foundation and its donors have been under . intense scrutiny in recent weeks. Republican critics say the . foundation makes Clinton, who is seeking the 2016 Democratic . presidential nomination, vulnerable to undue influence. Her campaign team calls these claims 'absurd conspiracy . theories'. Following Reuters' report Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz called on the non-profit to return all of the money it received from foreign governments. Scroll down for video . Under scrutiny: Charities run by the family of Hillary Clinton (seen at Georgetown University on Wednesday) under- or over-reported millions of dollars in donations from foreign governments in their tax returns . The errors, which have not been previously reported, appear . on the form 990s that all non-profit organizations must file . annually with the Internal Revenue Service to maintain their . tax-exempt status. A charity must show copies of the forms to . anyone who wants to see them to understand how the charity . raises and spends money. The unsettled numbers on the tax returns are not evidence of . wrongdoing but tend to undermine the 990s role as a form of . public accountability, experts in charity law and transparency . advocates told Reuters. 'If those numbers keep changing - well, actually, we spent . this on this, not that on that - it really defeats the purpose,' said Bill Allison, a senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation, a . government transparency advocacy group. For three years in a row beginning in 2010, the Clinton . Foundation reported to the IRS that it received zero in funds . from foreign and U.S. governments, a dramatic fall-off from the . tens of millions of dollars in foreign government contributions . reported in preceding years. Those entries were errors, according to the foundation: . several foreign governments continued to give tens of millions . of dollars toward the foundation's work on climate change and . economic development through this three-year period. Those governments were identified on the foundation's annually updated donor list, along with broad indications of how much each had cumulatively given since they began donating. 'We are prioritizing an external review to ensure the accuracy of the 990s from 2010, 2011 and 2012 and expect to refile when the review is completed,' Craig Minassian, a foundation spokesman, said in an email. The Clinton Foundation erroneously reported it had received no funds from governments for three years - even though it previously received millions. Pictured, Bill and Hillary speak about the charity last September . The decision to review the returns was made last month . following inquiries from Reuters, and the foundation has not . ruled out extending the review to tax returns extending back 15 . or so years. Minassian declined to comment on why the foundation had not . included the necessary break-down of government funding in its . 990 forms. He said it was rare to find an organization as . transparent as the foundation. 'No charity is required to disclose their donors,' he said. 'However, we voluntarily disclose our more than 300,000 donors . and post our audited financial statements on our website along . with the 990s for anyone to see.' Separately, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), the . foundation's flagship program, is refiling its form 990s for at . least two years, 2012 and 2013, CHAI spokeswoman Maura Daley . said, describing the incorrect government grant break-outs for . those two years as typographical errors. CHAI, which is best known for providing cheaper drugs for . tens of thousands of people with HIV around the world, began . filing separate tax returns in 2010, and has previously refiled . at least once both its 2010 and 2011 form 990s. Changes: In light of Hillary seeking the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, the foundation said it would  only continue to receive donations from six countries that are already supporting ongoing projects . 'I’m #ReadyforHillary to return all the money she raised from foreign nations,' Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said on Twitter. 'Add your name if you are too,' he added, including a link to a Cruz for President petition asking for supporters' email addresses and zip codes . For both those . years, CHAI said its initial filings had over-reported . government grants by more than $100 million. Some experts in charity law and taxes said it was not . remarkable for a charity to refile an erroneous return once in a . while, but for a large, global charity to refile three or four . years in a row was highly unusual. 'I've never seen amendment activity like that,' said Bruce . Hopkins, a Kansas City lawyer who has specialized in charity law . for more than four decades, referring to the CHAI filings. Clinton stepped down from the foundation's board of . directors this month but her husband, Bill Clinton, and their . daughter, Chelsea Clinton, remain directors. The foundation said last week after Hillary Clinton became a . candidate that it would continue to accept funding from foreign . governments, but only from six countries that are already . supporting ongoing projects. CHAI will also continue to receive . foreign government funding, again with additional restrictions. Nick Merrill, Clinton's spokesman, has declined to answer . inquiries about the foundation and CHAI. Though Mrs. Clinton has abdicated her board seat, GOP rival Cruz has zeroed in on the Democratic presidential candidate in a tweets about the Clinton Foundation's tax headaches. 'I’m #ReadyforHillary to return all the money she raised from foreign nations,' he said, referencing a pro-Clinton organization that spent more than a year laying the groundwork for her eventual announcement. 'Add your name if you are too,' he added, including a link to a Cruz for President petition asking for supporters' email addresses and zip codes.","Charities' errors generally took the form of under-reporting or over-reporting donations from foreign governments .

4748,"They are often an embarrassing topic that leaves many people unwilling to talk about them, let alone own up to having one. But analysis of popular search terms on Google has revealed the areas around the world that seem to be most concerned with sexually transmitted diseases. By far, the most searched for term globally is HIV and AIDS, followed by herpes and then Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) which can cause cervical cancer. The map above shows the countries in Europe with the highest and second highest number of searches per capita for different sexually transmitted diseases. The data was gathered using Google Trends . In the UK, chlamydia seemed to cause most concern, and is incidentally the most commonly diagnosed STD in the country according to official figures. However, in the US herpes was the most searched for term across the country, with Georgia being the state with the most searches for the virus. In Europe, Norway came out as what the maps called a 'herpes hotspot' generating the most searches per capita, followed by Montenegro. Russians seemed to be the most concerned about gonorrhea, while people in Finland were the biggest group searching for information about chlamydia. A study has discovered one in ten Americans think HTML - the name given to the code that makes up websites - is a sexually transmitted disease, while almost a third think a gigabyte is an insect. The research was carried out to determine how knowledgeable people are when it comes to tech terms, and how important they think tech is. Vouchercloud’s study asked 2,392 men and women aged over 18 to identify the meanings of a variety of words. These words were a mix of technical and non-technical terms, and each term was given with three multiple choice answers. Switzerland was the centre for the most searches about syphilis in Europe, while Croatians were the hotspot for HPV. Albania had the most searches for HIV/AIDS. In the US, Mississippi came out as the capital for gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia searches. While the data may reflect merely concern about the diseases, and so will in some cases highlight the most health conscious countries and states, it can also help to shed some light on where the incidence of STDs are highest. Mississippi has the highest rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea of all the 50 states in the US, for example. New York was found to be the hotspot for searches about HPV while the District of Columbia was the area that searched most for information about HIV/AIDS. It also has the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the country. Monitoring the spread of STDs is notoriously difficult due to the stigma that often surrounds them, which makes people reluctant to be tested or admit to infections. The analysis of STD web searches was conducted by Superdrug's Online Doctor service which offers medical support and advice over the internet. The map above shows the states where the highest and second highest number of searches for STDs . The data showed that most worldwide Google searches are about HIV/AIDs closely followed by herpes . Chlamydia and gential warts attracted the most searches in the UK in the past year, while in the US internet users seemed to be most concerned about herpes followed by chlamydia, as the graph above reveals . It said the searches seemed to reflect some of the underlying trends in the spread of STDs and treatment for them. For example, antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea has spread from east Asia to Europe over the past decade, which may explain why Russia shows the most searches for this condition. Switzerland has also seen an increase in syphilis cases since 2010, including congenital syphilis transmitted from mother to child. This graph and map shows the areas of the UK and US where herpes was searched for most, and how searches have changed in both countries over time. A spike in searches in both countries can be seen at the time when Harvard Medical School announced it had discovered potential new treatment for herpes in 2009 . The graph and map above show the hotspots in the US and the UK for searches about syphilis. It also shows that searches for the condition appear to be rising in both countries after falling slightly around 2009 . Many people may also be turning to the internet to find out information about STD's due to inadequate levels of support in the healthcare systems of their countries. In Albania, for example, which had the highest number of searches per capita for HIV/AIDS, just 2 per cent of healthcare clinics provide screening for HIV. Ukraine, which had the second highest number of searches for HIV, is suffering one of the worst AIDS epidemics in Europe. The research also examined searches for sexual dysfunction related terms and found that perhaps surprisingly, Italy came out as the capital for searches about the problem, along with premature ejaculation. Gonorrhea hotspots in the UK and US are shown in the map above while the graph also shows that searches for the term are increasing, although the data may be affected by searches for the name of a pop song by Lil Wayne released in September 2010 . Searches for HIV in the US and UK appear to be on the decline, although Oxford came out as the hotspot where in the UK where most people searched for information, while Leesburg came top in the US . Searches for information about chlamydia seem to be increasing dramatically in recent years. London and San Antonio come out as the cities where most people in the UK and US are searching about the diseease . West Virginia was the state with most searches about erectile dysfunction and Pennyslvania had the most searches for premature ejaculation. People in the UK and Germany both seemed to search most for Viagra, while in the US, Florida was the state with most searches for the drug. A spokesman for Superdrug's Online Doctor said: 'Sexual topics can be a difficult subject for anyone to discuss, especially when it comes to diseases and sexual dysfunctions. 'Yet behind this silence, the data show that these health issues are surprisingly common, and many people around the world are struggling with the discomfort and stigma of these conditions.' The research was carried out by Superdrug.","The most searched for term globally is HIV and AIDS, followed by herpes and then Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)

11125,"A photo of a relaxed and happy surfer seems all but a distant memory as that same man is now fighting for his life after being mauled by a Great White Shark. Chris Blowes, was viciously attacked by what has been described as a ' massive monster', about 350 metres offshore near Right Point on the south-western side of Fishery Bay in Port Lincoln National Park, when he was attacked at 9.45am on Saturday. The 26-year-old is in a critical condition at the Royal Adelaide hospital after the horrifying moment which was witnessed by about a dozen other surfers who were in the water at the time and believed the six-metre creature swam away with the surfer's leg and a surfboard in its jaw. Scroll down for video . Chris Blowes (pictured left) is fighting for his life after being mauled by a Great White shark in South Australia . Mr Blowes was taken to Port Lincoln hospital before being airlifted to Adelaide on Saturday . Mr Blowes' family have released a statement expressing their gratitude for all of the support and well wishes they have received during this traumatic time. 'Currently our sole focus is on our unified, unconditional support and belief towards Christopher’s big fight he has ahead, and we ask that our privacy in being able to provide that is respected at this time,' the statement said. 'From the bottom of our hearts we wish to thank his inspirational mates who rescued him and got him to safety and all of the wonderful medical professionals both here in Adelaide and in Pt Lincoln who have attended to Christopher.' A Royal Adelaide hospital spokesman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that Mr Blowes had lost a leg and was in a critical condition in intensive care. Onlookers have described the distressing moment they saw the surfer attacked by the predator. 'The shark came in and bit his leg off and the guys helped him in and carried him up the cliff,' said Glenn Lugg, who has been surfing in the area for 25 years. 'I was just watching the shark go out to the ocean with his board still attached. Obviously the shark still had his leg and he was still swimming around with it,' Mr Lugg told Adelaide Now. Friends have begun to send their love and support to Chris and his family on social media as he battles to stay alive following the horrendous incident . Concerned friends of Chris send their best wishes to him and his family . Friends have begun to send their love and support to Chris and his family on social media as he battles to stay alive following the horrendous incident. 'Thoughts are with Chris Blowes, family and friends. Get Well mate,' Daniel Gannon posted on Twitter. While Belinda Wicks posted on her Facebook page: 'Sending all my love and thoughts to Chris Blowes and family.' Mr Lugg was told to call an ambulance while his fellow surfers pulled Mr Blowes from the water, up the beach on a surfboard and into a car to take the 26-year-old to hospital. The shocked witness said the experience was 'pretty traumatic', but that everyone involved did a great job. A friend of Mr Blowes, Ty Swan, described the 26-year-old as a 'good bloke', and that he had been bitten in the middle of the thigh. Mr Swan placed a sign at the popular tourist beach to let others know of the attack. Another witness, who was surfing at the time, told Daily Mail Australia that 'there was blood everywhere'. The injured man was initially taken to Port Lincoln Hospital with life-threatening injuries but been been airlifted to Adelaide for further treatment. Shocked witnesses said after the attack, which took place at Fishery Bay, South Australia, the six-metre shark was seen swimming away with the surfer's leg in its mouth . The 26-year-old was airlifted to Adelaide for further treatment after he was bitten by a shark . Another man said those closest to the badly injured surfer acted quickly without any thought of danger to themselves. 'I was just watching the shark go out to the ocean with his board still attached,' another witness told the Sunday Mail. 'Obviously the shark still had his leg and he was still swimming around with it.' The man said even though he was 50 metres from the shark, he could see its 'massive' pectoral fin - and he had no doubts it was a great white shark, the most feared creature in the sea. However details of the type of shark and the man's injuries have not been released or confirmed. Mr Blowes is in a critical condition after the shark attack in Fishery Bay, Port Lincoln, in South Australia . Fishery Bay is on South Australia's west coast, which is about seven hours from Adelaide . Witnesses have described the horrifying moment that they saw Mr Blowes mauled by a Great White shark . After the shark victim had been brought ashore and carried up a slope to a parking area, he was loaded into a car. He remains in a critical condition after beign airlifted via a MedSTAR retrieval team to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for further treatment. Police were working with Fisheries officials, the local council and Surf Life Saving SA to post signs on the beach warning others promptly after the shark attack. The attack happened during conditions that police and marine experts have previously said are dangerous. The overcast conditions make it difficult for surfers to see sharks that might be in the area and it is believed that sharks often mistake humans for seals or dolphins. The incident comes after surfer Jake Heron managed to fight off a four metre Great White at the same beach 10 years ago which attacked him just 10 metres from shore by punching and kicking it . He escaped with 20 stitches in his arm and 40 stitches in his thigh. Jake Heron was mauled by a four-metre Great White in 2005 . Wildcatch Fisheries SA chairman Jonas Woolford said the number of shark sightings in the area had risen recently. 'There has been a number of sightings just recently actually at a number of locations along the coast near to Fishery Bay, just around the corner, the sightings have said that the sharks have been rather aggressive actually,' Mr Woolford told the ABC. 'It's been reported that there hasn't been many for about 10 or so weeks, so whether those ones that have been laying low are now coming back to the areas which they normally frequent and they may be rather hungry ... but yes, there has been more sightings around just recently.'","Chris Blowes was attacked by a Great White shark about 350 metres offshore near Right Point on the south-western side of Fishery Bay in Port Lincoln National Park .

8226,"Up to 100 Islamic teachers could be banned from working in schools for life following an investigation into their alleged links to the Trojan Horse scandal. It is understood a teaching watchdog is working on possible disciplinary cases against current and former staff members at some schools in Birmingham where extremist Islamic views were being forced on pupils and staff. This includes allegations an al-Qaeda style video featuring masked gunmen was copied in a classroom and teachers punished pupils by making them kneel on tiles. More than 50 teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged as many as 3,000 messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby was a hoax. Scroll down for video . Park View School in Birmingham was one of the schools placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism - up to 100 teachers are now being investigated . It is understood the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) - the profession's watchdog responsible for banning teachers from classrooms - is looking at 30 disciplinary cases, with an expectation many more teachers will be targeted for their part in the affair. The probe into the Islamic plot last year found evidence of anti-Western rhetoric, intolerance towards gays and creating the perception of a worldwide conspiracy against Muslims. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Allegations under investigation include claims that an al-Qaeda style video was copied at Park View Academy and teachers punished children by making them kneel on the floor, the Sunday Times reports. A group of teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group where they claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby and the Boston bombings, where two bombs were set off at the finish line of the city's marathon, were a hoax. Professional hearings are set to begin next month. More than 50 teachers alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich,  was a hoax . In his report, Peter Clarke (pictured) found there had been a 'coordinated, deliberate and sustained action' to introduce an aggressive Islamic ethos in the schools . The teaching watchdog has obtained 'dossiers' about some of the 100 staff it is investigating from the Department for Education as part of its inquiries. They are understood to include information from last year's Trojan Horse probe headed by Peter Clarke, the former head of counterterrorism at Scotland Yard. His report, published in July, found there had been a 'co-ordinated, deliberate and sustained action, carried out by a number of associated individuals, to introduce an intolerant and aggressive Islamic ethos into a few schools in Birmingham'. It also highlighted a 'disconcerting pattern' in the schools, including nepotism in staff appointments, bullying of senior teachers, a 'strategy of harassment to oust the head teacher' and the 'reinforcement of Muslim identity to the exclusion or disparagement of others'. A source told the Sunday Times: 'The 100 or so include teachers, teaching assistants and teaching staff. The Department for Education is feeding in information to help corroborate some of what the NCTL has, and, in other cases, flag up new targets.' 'In some cases, some of those teachers and staff are still working at schools, and in other cases they have been removed. 'But although some of them have been removed, the NCTL does not want them to end up anywhere else.' The Trojan Horse scandal started with an anonymous letter in March last year describing an Islamic plot to take over schools in Birmingham called 'Operation Trojan Horse'. The document - now thought to be a hoax - proposed a campaign of installing governors and undermining and then replacing school leaders with staff who would be more sympathetic to their religious agenda. That in turn led to 21 schools being inspected by schools inspector Ofsted, which put six schools in special measures and said five had not done enough to protect children from extremism. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Then in November last year, inspectors found evidence that six independent faith schools in Tower Hamlets, in east London, had an unbalanced curriculum. Several teenage girls have fled to join ISIS in Syria from schools in Tower Hamlets. This Easter, tens of thousands of leaflets were distributed by Tower Hamlets council advising parents to 'lock away' their children's passports if they fear the youngsters may be planning to travel to Syria over the holiday period. Tower Hamlets is the only local authority in London where Muslims account for the largest single religious group. An estimated 35 per cent of the population practise Islam, compared with 4.4 per cent across the country according to the latest census.","A teaching watchdog is working on possible disciplinary cases against current and former staff members at some schools in Birmingham .

10021,"An ex-convict who told cops he fatally stabbed his ex-girlfriend, then cooked and ate some of her organs, may now also be charged with raping her. Joseph Oberhansley, from Jeffersonville, Indiana, is charged with murder and abuse of a corpse in the death of 46-year-old Tammy Jo Harbin Blanton last September. On Tuesday, Clark County Prosecutor Jeremy Mull asked for rape to be added to those charges and a judge will consider the request on May 4, the Courier-Journal of Louisville reported. The motion to change the charges comes after lab results for the victim's body were returned. 'Cannibal killer': Joseph Oberhansley, who admitted to killing his ex-girlfriend before eating some of her organs last year, could now face a rape charge. Prosecutors say they will recommend the death penalty . Murdered: Tammy Jo Blanton, right, had called police asking for help just hours before she was found dead . Last year, prosecutors said they intended to seek the death penalty in the case. Juries in Indiana cannot recommend a death sentence or life without parole unless they agree there is at least one aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, the law says. Rape, burglary and dismemberment are among those aggravated circumstances. Oberhansley, now 34, was convicted of manslaughter in the 1998 shooting death of his then-girlfriend, 17-year-old Sabrina Elder, in Salt Lake City just days after the birth of their son. He served 14 years behind bars for the crime and was discharged from parole on July 23 last year. Convict: In 1998, Oberhansley, then a teenager, was imprisoned for killing his 17-year-old girlfriend . On July 31, Tammy Jo Blanton posted his $500 bond for charges of criminal recklessness and resisting law enforcement stemming from a car chase. Then on September 11, she called 911 at around 3am to report that her jilted boyfriend was outside her home and would not leave, according to the probable cause affidavit. Officers arrived on the scene and ordered Oberhansley to leave after Blanton spoke to him outside. At around 10am that morning, police got another call, this time from Blanton's co-worker, asking them to perform a welfare check after she failed to show up for work. Police found that the back door had been forced open and inside, officers discovered Blanton dead under a tarpaulin in the blood-spattered bathroom of her home, with fatal injuries to her head, neck and torso. 'The front of the victim's skull appeared to have been crushed and brain tissue appeared scattered around the bathtub,' the affidavit stated. The statement added that they found a plate covered in blood and bone, as well as bloodied cooking utensils, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported. Scene: Oberhansley allegedly broke down Blanton's backdoor at her Jeffersonville home, pictured, and then forced his way into her bathroom, where she was hiding, and repeatedly stabbed her . When questioned by police, Oberhansley confessed to forcing his way into the bathroom, where Blanton had locked herself, and repeatedly stabbing her. Oberhansley told police he then used an electric jigsaw to open Blanton's skull and ate parts of her brain, heart and lungs. The blade was allegedly recovered from the scene after the grisly death. A trial date is expected to be set by the end of April.

5078,"Labour will ban bosses employing regular staff on zero-hours contracts for any longer than 12 weeks. Ed Miliband said it was 'not good enough' for millions of workers not to know how many hours they would be working from one week to the next. He said a Labour government would give workers the right to demand a 'regular contract if they do regular hours' after three months. Scroll down for video . Labour party leader Ed Miliband announced the zero-hours contract ban to workers at David Brown Gear Systems in Huddersfield this morning . Mr Miliband said it was 'not good enough' for millions of workers not to know how many hours they would be working from one week to the next . Mr Miliband's announcement comes after David Cameron struggled to say if he could live on a zero-hours contract after being grilled by Jeremy Paxman last week. In an interview with BBC Breakfast this morning, Mr Miliband said: 'If it's not good enough for us, I don't think it is good enough for the people of Britain, and that's why we have got to make this change.' Mr Miliband said there had been an 'epidemic' of zero-hours contracts under the Coalition and dismissed fears scrapping them could force companies to lay off staff. It is estimated there are now 1.8million contracts in the UK that do not guarantee any hours – with as many as one in seven jobs now zero-hours. ONS data shows that 58 per cent of people on zero-hours contracts have been with their current employer for over a year, and that workers on the contracts work 23 hours a week on average. Mr Miliband said workers should be given the right after 12 weeks  to demand 'a regular contract if they do regular hours'. He said: 'I think it goes right to the heart of the election campaign. I don't believe we can build a successful country when working people are facing that kind of insecurity. 'There is an issue about the number of hours, but there is also an issue about the unpredictability of the hours. That's the insecurity people face.' The Labour Party leader  arrived in Yorkshire this morning for a question and answer session with workers on the second full-day of the campaign . He said most businesses did not use zero-hours contracts, but added: 'The trouble is for some businesses this has become the primary way that they employ people and I don't think it's the right way forward for our country. 'Zero hour contracts are just one example of the insecurity of our economy and what has happened over the last five years. David Cameron says it has all been a great success – I'll let the British people be the judge of that.' The Tories have already announced that it would ban exclusivity clauses which stop staff on zero-hours contracts from working for other companies. Under Labour's plan, workers will also be entitled to compensation if shifts are cancelled at short notice. The proposal goes well beyond the recommendations made by the former Morrisons exec Norman Pickavance in an independent review for Labour. He said workers should have a right to request a regular contract after six months' continuous employment and to be given one after 12 months. Critics have warned that company bosses could dismiss staff just before the right to a full contract kicks in. It also risks undermining Britain's flexible labour market which economists claim is behind the recent jobs boom. Jeremy Paxman grilled David Cameron over the number of zero-hours contracts in the UK workforce . But Mr Miliband told Labour activists later today: 'The problem of zero-hours contracts is at the heart of the key question in this election: who does our country work for? 'Does it work just for the rich and the powerful? Or does it work for working people – the people looking for a job, trying to find enough money to support a family, to make ends meet?' Christian May, of the Institute of Directors said zero-hours contracts were used by just '2 per cent of workers' which he said could 'hardly be described as an epidemic'. He added: 'Nobody supports the misuse of these contracts, but demonising and ultimately outlawing them will simply risk jobs and undermine a labour market that has made us the envy of Europe.' John Cridland, CBI director-general, added: 'The UK's flexible jobs market has given us an employment rate that is the envy of other countries, so proposals to limit flexible contracts to 12 weeks are wide of the mark. 'Of course action should be taken to tackle abuses, but demonising flexible contracts is playing with the jobs that many firms and many workers value and need. 'These proposals run the risk of a return to day-to-day hiring in parts of the economy, with lower stability for workers and fewer opportunities for people to break out of low pay.' But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said 'We need a fairer system that guarantees zero-hours workers decent rights at work and stops them from being treated like second-class employees.'","Labour will ban bosses employing regular staff on zero-hours contracts for any longer than 12 weeks .

9337,"He is known for being meticulous in his preparations for major tennis tournaments. But when it comes to the biggest event in his life, Andy Murray is happy to take a back seat. The 2013 Wimbledon champion and Olympic gold medalist has revealed he has left the vast majority of planning next week's wedding to his fiancée, Kim Sears. Scroll down for video . Murray will marry long-term girlfriend Kim Sears at Dunblane Cathedral next week - he is pictured as best man at brother Jamie's wedding to Alejandra Gutierrez at the Cromlix House Hotel in 2010 . Murray was presented with a cake to mark his 500th ATP Tour victory cake in Miami this week - for his wedding he has said he was involved in the cake tasting, but has left the majority to his fiancee . Miss Sears, 27, pictured in Miami, has been been entrusted with planning the pair's wedding next week . Murray and Miss Sears, both 27, will tie the knot at Dunblane Cathedral next week, and the tennis star has admitted he 'couldn't care less' about the finer details of the day saying 'I try to stay out of all that sort of stuff'. However Murray, a self-confessed foodie, will have some input for the wedding as he has chosen the menu based on a series of food tasting sessions. In an American interview, the 2012 US Open winner, said: 'I think in a lot of cases it's just better to let the woman have it how she would like. 'In terms of flowers and colour schemes and those sorts of things, I couldn't really care less about that, to be honest. 'The only thing I wanted to do was to be involved with the food. Because I like my food - I like good food. 'I went along and did the food tasting, and I also did the cake tasting as well. So that would be the thing that I would say I have been most involved in.' He added: 'The music is something we chat about together as well.' Miss Sears is in charge of colours schemes and flowers as Murray admits 'he couldn't care less about that' The 27-year-old has been a permanent fixture at the court side since she and Murray started dating in 2005 . Sussex-born Miss Sears, who is the daughter of former Lawn Tennis Association head of women's tennis Nigel Sears, met Murray at the US Open in 2005 . The couple have dated since they met in 2005 . Murray and Miss Sears, who have been together for a decade, will wed at the 1000-year old Dunblane Cathedral and not, as anticipated, in the tiny chapel at his Cromlix House Hotel, near the Perthshire town where he grew up. The 12th century cathedral is much larger than the chapel in the grounds of Cromlix, which seats only 28. Murray purchased the 15-bedroom country home for £1.8m in 2013. Thousands are expected to line the streets of Dunblane on the day to celebrate the wedding of their most famous son. Murray attended the primary school in 1996 when gunman Thomas Hamilton killed sixteen children and one teacher in the Dunblane massacre. Murray's uncle Niall Erskine said: 'I'm sure it will be a popular decision, as he's had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past. 'Andy is looking forward to bringing all his family and friends to Dunblane. I'm sure lots of people will come down to see the cars as they go past and it will be a very popular day.' The cathedral's minister, the Rev Colin Renwick, added: 'There is excitement because there is a great deal of affection for Andy in Dunblane and a great deal of pride in him. I think people are genuinely very pleased for him.' Tom Casey, chair of Discover Dunblane, the organisation which represents the town's traders, said the couple would be 'Dunblane's royalty'. He said: 'A number of shops will be doing individual things to mark the event as they normally do when Andy is playing tennis. 'As a town, we are going to put up some bunting and wedding bows along the high street and decorate the shops with messages. 'Of course we will be making extra efforts to celebrate the wedding of Dunblane's most famous son of modern sense. He is our royalty. 'But it is also important we respect the family's wishes.' Next week's ceremony will take place at the 12th century Dunblane Cathedral (pictured) The reception will then be at Cromlix House (pictured), the five-star 15-bedroom country hotel Murray bought for £1.8million two years ago . The couple announced their engagement in November last year. Breaking with tradition, Murray will have three best men at his wedding, his brother Jamie, close friend and tennis player Ross Hutchins (who recovered from cancer to return to tennis) and former training partner Carlos Mier. It is believed Miss Sears will have four bridesmaids. Murray said: 'The thing for me is it's double standards in a way with the guys and girls because Kim has four bridesmaids and I was saying well, ""why is that fine for you?"" 'Imagine you had to pick one of your four best friends which you've had since you were at school. it's very difficult to chose one. 'She was like, ""Come on, come on, pick one"". I said, ""No, it's difficult, so I think I'm going to have two for sure possibly a third if he can come'."" Murray has previously played best man at Jamie's wedding when he married Alejandra Gutierrez at Cromlix House in 2010, and when Ross Hutchins tied the knot with Lindsay Wood last year. The tennis star roars in celebration after defeating Tomas Berdych in the Miami Open semi final yesterday . In previous interviews on the subject, Murray has said he is not fazed by the prospect of marriage. 'Kim and I had spoken about getting married a lot for the past couple of years but, if you go back a couple of years, we were still only 25. 'We've been together since we were 18. Because we were so young when we started - and we do spend a lot of time apart - it just felt like the right time for both of us.' Sussex-born Miss Sears, who is the daughter of former Lawn Tennis Association head of women's tennis Nigel Sears, met Murray at the US Open in 2005. She was once described by future mother-in-law Judy Murray as 'the best thing to happen to Andy'. They split briefly in 2009, before rekindling their relationship. The couple live in Surrey with their two Border terriers, Maggie and Rusty. Back on the court, Murray will face world number one Novak Djokovic in the final of the Miami Open tomorrow. Third seed Murray beat Czech eighth seed Tomas Berdych 6-4 6-4 yesterday to reach the final for a fourth time.","Andy Murray will marry long-term girlfriend Kim Sears at Dunblane Cathedral next week .

9645,"One in five parents sedates their children before a long road trip, despite fears the medication can cause breathing problems. A national driving survey analysed the travel habits of 3700 Australian families which revealed four in five families use technology to deal with bored children, giving them a hand held computer game, like an iPad, while another 70 per cent said they give their kids treats to sweeten the ride. Almost 20 per cent of NSW families use a more extreme technique, admitting they have used sedatives like the antihistamine Phenergan to knock their kids out so their journey will be more pleasant. One in five NSW families have admitted to sedating their children before taking them on long car trips . The over the counter drug Phenergan is commonly used to treat allergies however it contains a sedative called promethazine which is widely known to cause breathing problems in young children. The medical community claim the sedative Phenergan should not be used on children younger than two years old as side effects like respiratory depression, more commonly known as hypoventilation, can be fatal. Warnings about the use of drugs like Phenergan on children have been around since 2006 when the US Food and Drug Administration found the medication was linked to 22 cases of respiratory depression in infants, seven of which were fatal. Westmead Children's Hospital head of general medicine Joanne Ging told Fairfax that Phenergan is far too unpredictable to use as a sedative on children. The medical community claim the sedative Phenergan should not be used on children younger than two years old as side effects like respiratory depression can be fatal. 'We would never recommend it for children on plane trips, car trips or wherever, because its side effects can trigger the exact opposite effect, including hallucinations. It's a medication that really should only ever be used for allergies.' Family therapist and child psychologist Michael Hawton condemned the trend labelling it 'extraordinary' and 'horrible'. 'The whole idea of heading off on a family holiday is to enjoy time together. There's a big difference between entertaining your children and medically straitjacketing them,' he said. 'The whole idea of heading off on a family holiday is to enjoy time together. There's a big difference between entertaining your children and medically straitjacketing them' Respiratory depression refers to a decrease in a person's ability to inhale a sufficient amount of oxygen and exhale enough carbon dioxide. Simply, the person will have difficulty in breathing. This can cause the person to appear out of breath and often lead to a tightness in the chest. The survey also revealed more than half of parents said they are 'sometimes distracted' by their kids who fight, kick the seat or intentionally interfere with the driver. Around 56 per cent of drivers admitted to turning the music up to drown the children out with a further 64 per cent of parents claiming they have threatened children that they will stop the car and leave the unruly kids behind.","One in five parents sedates their children before a long road trip .

6567,"Two British men have been fined $3,000 for threatening behaviour on board a Thomson Airways flight. One allegedly threw peanuts and a pound coin at cabin crew, with the other was accused of hitting himself on the head with clenched fists during the disturbance, which forced the flight from London to Mexico to divert to Bermuda. Jamie Richardson, 38, from Lancing, West Sussex and Daniel Taylor, 37, from Worthing, West Sussex, both pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour in a Bermuda court. Scroll down for video . Polcie were seen entering the grounded plane at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda . The two holidaymakers could also face a four-month jail term, with local sources claiming the pair are struggling to pay the fee as they have only $700 between them. The Royal Gazette reported that at the hearing the prosecutor reported the two men to be intoxicated at the point of boarding the the Boeing 787-8 at London Gatwick at around 9.40am on Sunday morning. The court heard how, despite being seated apart, Richardson and Taylor pestered the cabin crew for drinks and caused havoc in the cabin. Taylor is said to have stood on the foot of one member of staff, and both men were accused of shouting and swearing during the flight. After being told to stop, the two reportedly claimed 'we are drug dealers.' Taylor then threw his wallet to Richardson, who wanted to buy some peanuts. On throwing back the wallet, a fellow passenger was hit on the head. Bermuda Police confirmed two men were taken into custody after reports of unruly behviour on a plane . Richardson later the peanuts and a pound coin at staff, while Taylor continued to act in an aggressive manner. Taylor then refused a final written warning from cabin staff. The pilot was notified of the action in the cabin, and took the decision to make an unscheduled landing at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda, seven-and-a-half hours into the flight. The plane, carrying 278 passengers, was met by six police cars on landing, with officers seen entering the aircraft and removing the passengers. In their defence, both men said they had taken sleeping pills, and that these, when mixed with alcohol, forced them to behave irrationally. Their attorney Alexandra Wheatley expressed the concern that the two men cannot afford their respective fines and asked for the amount to be revised. But magistrate Magistrate Khamisi Tokunbo dismissed this as a legitimate reason and believed the fine was fair. 'In these times it could be a lot harsher – you can’t mess around in the air these days,' he said. A statement on the Bermuda Police website read: 'Around 12:55pm on Sunday, April 12 police officers responded to a report of two disruptive passengers on a diverted Thomson Airways flight landing at LF Wade International Airport. 'The two male passengers involved were subsequently escorted off the plane and taken into police custody. 'The Thomson aircraft was apparently en route from London, U.K. to Cancun, Mexico.' It is not known at this time as to the nationality or the exact actions of the two passengers arrested . A spokesperson for Thomson Airways told MailOnline Travel: 'Thomson Airways would like to apologise for any inconvenience experienced by passengers on board flight TOM022 from London Gatwick Airport to Cancun, which diverted to Bermuda yesterday due to a customer incident on board. 'We operate a zero tolerance policy in relation to any disruptive behaviour. The passengers in question were removed from the aircraft and met by police. 'The flight departed within two hours to ensure the other customers could get away on their holiday as soon as possible.

8607,"Vulnerable boys were trafficked from a children’s home before being abused by ‘very powerful’ figures in a Westminster paedophile ring, a victim has claimed. Richard Kerr, 53, said he was one of three youngsters who were taken from the home in Belfast to London in the 1970s. Once in the capital, they were allegedly molested by politicians and other Establishment figures at Dolphin Square and Elm Guest House – which are now under investigation by Scotland Yard. Claims: Richard Kerr, 53, said he was abused by ‘powerful people’ in a Westminster paedophile ring . His account provides the first clear link between three alleged major VIP paedophile rings that operated in London and Northern Ireland. And the claims will add weight to calls for the allegations about the Irish children’s home to be covered by the official abuse inquiry now being chaired by judge Lowell Goddard. Mr Kerr told how he suffered abuse at Kincora children’s home in Belfast, where victims have accused MI5 of blocking police inquiries. He said he and two other boys were then trafficked to London in 1977, where they suffered further abuse in two locations. He said he endured his most violent ordeal at Elm Guest House in Barnes, south-west London. Boys – many in local authority care – are alleged to have been abused by figures including the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith, Cabinet ministers, clergymen, pop stars, spies, judges and members of the royal household. Site 1: The Kincora children’s home in Belfast. Mr Kerr said he was one of three youngsters who were taken from the home to London in the 1970s . ‘I was tied up here. I do remember that. I don’t know why I was tied up, but I was tied up with my hands behind my back,’ he told Channel 4 News. ‘They took photographs. Other men were there. Other men came into the room. It wasn’t just this one man.’ Site 2: Location of the former Elm Guest House in Barnes, south-west London . Mr Kerr, who now lives in Dallas, Texas, made a highly emotional return to London last month to visit the scenes of his alleged abuse for the first time in over three decades. He claimed he was also taken to the exclusive Dolphin Square apartment complex in Pimlico, where police are investigating allegations that a Conservative MP murdered a young boy. He said: ‘I remember going in with this guy. He told me to sit down and relax and explained about his [drinking] glasses. ‘He had Waterford Crystal and he wanted me to have a brandy, and we had a small one. And then we had a sexual encounter.’ Scotland Yard has said allegations surrounding the murder of three boys by a VIP paedophile ring linked to Dolphin Square are ‘credible and true’. One alleged victim, known only as Nick, has already claimed he saw a Conservative MP strangle a 12-year-old boy around 1980 and that a Tory Cabinet minister watched as another boy was murdered the following year. Mr Kerr, whose full interview will be broadcast by Channel 4 News at 7pm tonight, said the two boys from Kincora children’s home who were taken to London with him both went on to kill themselves. He said his abusers included politicians but he still had fears about naming them. ‘I need to know that I can have faith in our government,’ he said. ‘But right now, when they’re not willing to bring Kincora into Westminster, the message that sends to me is that there’s some kind of cover-up, and there has been.’ Abuse victims were granted leave in February to bring a legal challenge to the Government’s refusal to include Kincora in the remit of Justice Goddard’s wide-ranging abuse inquiry. Site 3: Dolphin Square luxury flats complex in Pimlico, London. Police are investigating allegations that a Conservative MP murdered a young boy there . The children’s home in east Belfast was run by William McGrath, the head of an extreme Protestant loyalist group called Tara and an alleged MI5 informant. He and two other members of staff – William Semple and Joseph Mains – were jailed in 1981 for sexually assaulting boys in their care. But Mr Kerr, who was sent to live at Kincora in 1975 aged 14, said two plain clothes policemen visited him before the trial and warned him not to talk. In February, lawyers for the victims told the High Court in Belfast that MI5 was aware of the abuse but allowed it to continue to protect those responsible from prosecution. Home Secretary Theresa May said last month that Justice Goddard’s abuse inquiry would share information with a separate review being held in Northern Ireland.","Richard Kerr, 53, said he was one of three youngsters who were taken from the home in Belfast to London in the 1970s .

Protesters also engaged with a group of Orioles fans at Slider's Bar and Grille and began fighting with patrons. A woman inside one of the restaurants jumped in front of the protesters and begged them to stop throwing things. At least two bystanders - a man and woman - were bleeding from the head.

They filled two city blocks and marched 2 miles to City Hall, where the crowd overtook the grassy plaza adjacent from the building. Tanya Peacher, a 36-year-old Baltimore resident, said she'd never attended a protest in the city before, but watching a video of Gray's arrest motivated her. 'I looked at my son,' she said, 'and thought ''that is my son.'' Late on Friday, Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis said Gray should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested - before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt, a violation of the department's policy..

Six officers involved in the case have been suspended with pay pending the results of an investigation that includes an independent review. On Saturday, residents young and old, from Baltimore and beyond, gathered around noon and voiced their anger at how the department and the city's officials are handling the investigation into Gray's death. At one point, the crowd paused for a moment of silence in front of Shock Trauma, the hospital where Gray died. The marchers then migrated to Camden Yards. At a downtown intersection, a dozen marchers laid down in the street during an impromptu 'die-in.' The police department has conceded Gray should have received medical attention when he asked for it . People lay in the streets on Saturday afternoon mimicking the way Gray was held as he cried for help during his arrest . Wearing a sign around his neck that said 'I am Freddie Gray,' 33-year-old Dante Acree joined thousands of others outside City Hall. Acree said he came out to the protest because 'it could have been one of my kids.' 'It could have been my brother, my father,' he said. 'I'd want the same support.' Leonard Patterson, 56, said he drove from Manassas, Virginia, to be a part of the protest. Patterson said he decided to come after thinking about his college-aged daughter. 'I'm trying to do everything in my limbs, everything in my power, to make this a better world for her,' said Patterson, holding up his black and white drawing of Freddie Gray. The drawing shows Gray being hoisted from a police van to heaven by two angels. 'I'm here to do what I can. Police brutality is as old as the 1950s, the 1960s. It's still here,' he said.

Bundchen's success with her healthy good looks was heralded as marking the end of the sickly skinny and bedraggled ""heroin chic"" look that had dominated runways for years.

11049,"Luke Shaw admitted he has struggled to cope with the demands of playing for Manchester United after he returned to the team against Chelsea. Shaw has started seeing a psychologist in recent weeks as he comes to terms with his £28million move from Southampton to Old Trafford in the summer. The left back, who had a decent game on his return to the team at Stamford Bridge, said: 'I am still young and coming to the biggest club in the world hasn't been easy for me. Manchester United left back Luke Shaw (right) chases the ball ahead of Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic (left) Shaw (right) tussles with Chelsea forward Eden Hazard (left) during the Premier League match on Saturday . Shaw admits that he has struggled to live up to his £28million price tag since joining Manchester United . 'I wouldn't say it has been a hard three weeks but it has been a three weeks that I have been able to learn a lot more about myself, so it has been a nice three weeks in that respect and good to get on the pitch again.' Shaw claims he had a minor back injury when he was substituted at half-time against Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-final defeat at Old Trafford last month, but he was left out of the team by Louis van Gaal for the next four games. Shaw added: 'He has two sides to him, but he is genuinely a really nice guy and a great manager. 'You have seen what he has turned United into in recent weeks but that is because there is a really focused side, where you have to give 100 per cent in every training session and game and be focused all the time. 'If you don't give that, he won't play you and that's what he is like.' The 19-year-old has played 19 times in all competitions for United this campaign, after featuring in twice as many matches for Southampton last season. 'I haven't been playing and there have been a lot of negative comments about me,' he said. 'It is something that isn't nice and I've tried to ignore it but hopefully this is the start of me coming back. 'I saw a comment the other day saying I was taken off at half-time against Arsenal because I wasn't fit enough, but that's not true at all.

These pictures capture the amazing moment when one of the notoriously slow-moving reptiles escaped becoming big cat fast food  by retreating into its shell before scuttling off across desert sands. The baffled cheetahs surrounded the tortoise and attempted to scare it out of its shell with snarls but the reptile kept well tucked up inside its tough exterior forcing the big cats to wander off in search of another snack. Hard target: The tortoise attempts a quick getaway under the watchful eye of one of the curious cheetahs . Confused: The two cheetahs exchange glances as they move in to size up their potential meal . The intriguing scene was captured by John Mullineux, a chemical engineer from Secunda, South Africa. He said: 'While driving on the sandy tracks of the Kalahari Desert in South Africa, I came across two cheetahs lying in the shade near the road. 'Shortly after I stopped, they got up and slowly headed to the dunes. 'Halfway up the red sandy dune the younger one stopped to inspect a tortoise, the older one also stopped and tried to bite the shell but couldn't manage it. Now you see me: The tortoise retreats into its shell as the big cats get too close for comfort . Snarl: One of the cheetahs gets up close and personal to the little reptile and tries to scare it out of its shell . 'By the time the older cheetah had made it to the top of the dune, the younger one decided to run off and follow rather than spend more time at the hard meal. 'The tortoise then casually moved on as if nothing unusual had happened. From a young age I have loved cheetahs for their elegance and speed - seeing two so close was dream but seeing them size up their lunch was unique. 'It was something that was both exciting and naturally beautiful at the same time.' Slow and steady: The tortoise continues his escape across the sands of the Kalahari desert in South Africa . John Mullineux, a chemical engineer from Secunda, South Africa,spotted the scene while driving along a desert track .

9704,"Ever wondered if your personality was decided at birth? It turns out, the order in which you were born can not only have an effect on your personality, but also your chances of academic success. According to Canadian duo Mitchell Moffit and Greg Brown, from Toronto, who present an online science show, several theories suggest that where you are in your family determines who you are. Scroll down for video . (Pictured from left to right: Khloé, Kourtney and Kim Kardashian). The Kardashians are a strong example of a large celebrity family where the siblings share very different personality traits . On AsapSCIENCE on YouTube, the pair discuss how being the first, middle, youngest, or an only child affects us. The personality traits are also supposedly affected by whether parents have high expectations and how strict they were. FIRST-BORNS . According to Mitchell and Brown, first-born children are expected to be higher academic achievers and more ambitious. They also have a stronger sense of responsibility and are generally more mature. (Pictured from left to right) Beyoncé and Kate Middleton are famous first-borns. Oldest children tend be ambitious and have strong leadership skills . They also tend to have better leadership skills than other birth orders. The explanation is because although they get a lot more affection and attention from their parents, their parents have higher expectations as the first child. This works as a self-fulfilling prophecy: if there are high expectations placed on you, you are more likely to want to work hard and live up to these expectations. (Pictured from left to right) Kim Kardashian and Madonna are famous middle-borns. Middle children tend to be co-operative and are more likely to be social butterflies . MIDDLE-BORNS . Middle-born children apparently tend to be more co-operative, flexible and sociable. They are also the birth order that are able to make and maintain friendships easily. This is due to the fact that as a middle-born child, there aren't the high expectations of the first child, nor the relaxed attitude accorded to the last child. As a result, they also tend to be less ambitious than their older brothers and sisters, and so will have a more relaxed attitude in life. As middle children receive less attention than their other siblings, they seek out relationships and friendships outside of their family, and can be social butterflies. (Pictured from left to right) Jennifer Lawrence and Angelina Jolie are famous youngest children. Last-borns tend to be charming and confident . LAST-BORNS . The video highlights how youngest children tend to be likeable and charming. Other traits they carry are that they are more creative than older siblings, and have a stronger sense of security and confidence. As their parents have already had other children, they tend to be a lot less strict and are a lot more lenient with their youngest children. Parents' expectations will also be lower. As a result, youngest children will generally be less responsible and mature than older siblings, as they constantly feel like others will take the lead. (Pictured from left to right) Leonardo DiCaprio and Drew Barrymore are famous only-children. Only children tend to be creative and responsible . ONLY CHILD . Only children tend to be academically-able, creative and resourceful. They are also mature and responsible, and dislike disorder and like to be in control. Being a parent's only child, expectations are always high, but unlike a first-born, they never need to fight for the attention of their parents. Not to mention, being in a household with only adults often leads the child to mature more quickly and copy the actions of the parents, rather than being moulded by siblings' childish or youthful interests. But because they have never had to interact with siblings or companions of a similar age, they can have trouble relating to peers and can feel out of control when things in their life don't go their way. The presenters of the video highlight that these are just theories relating to order of birth. They add that gender, social status, age gaps between siblings and the number of siblings can play a huge role in determining traits. Moffit and Brown reiterate: 'Some aspects may be true for you, or make a lot of sense, but it wouldn’t be the same for every single person around the world in your specific birth order. 'It’s important to remember that your personality and your destiny in life is not predetermined at birth.'","Canadian duo Mitchell Moffit and Greg Brown discuss how being the first, middle, youngest, or an only child affects us .

6993,"A woman who successfully set up her brother with one of her best friends ended up becoming so jealous of their relationship she tried to wreck their marriage. Husband and wife David and Sandra Greatrex, 53 and 52, from Plymouth, have told their shocking story of harassment, which culminated in David's sister Anne cancelling the couple's wedding using a fake email address just weeks before the big day. The couple have spoken about their family feud on Channel 5 documentary, Family Secrets and Lies, which airs tonight. Scroll down for video . David, 53, and wife Sandra, 52, from Plymouth, were harassmed by David's sister . 'I was in tears and was so angry. I did not think someone was capable of doing that,' says Sandra of the horrifying moment Anne informed them she'd managed to cancel their nuptials behind their back. 'Everything was paid for so it was a lot of worry,' she added. Luckily, the couple managed to piece their  plans back together in time for their winter wedding though. and they subsequently took Anne to court for harassment. Sandra first met David after his 20-year marriage fell apart and her friend Anne, David's sister, suggested they meet. 'I met Anne for coffee and David came out and I've never let his side since,' she says. 'When I first met him I didn’t realise how important he would become. He’s my everything.' Before long the couple were inseparable. But although Anne's matchmaking had worked, she was not happy about their relationship and started sending Sandra threatening text messages telling her to stop seeing her brother. 'They were hurtful at the time but I couldn’t understand why. Maybe it was jealousy,' says Sandra. ‘My mum had lung cancer and was going through chemo at the time. Anne was sending messages saying, ""Your mum’s dying and you better get back to her"".' Ann Duffy, pretended to be her now sister-in-law and cancelled her brother's wedding . But the relationship continued and Sandra and David became even closer. Then one day Sandra proposed. 'I was joking around - but not,' says Sandra. Then David took the hint and gave Sandra a romantic proposal. For a while the angry texts from Anne tailed off. 'We went to the registry office, put the deposit down and made special invites - I couldn't believe it was really happening,' Sandra says of the wedding. 'My mum got involved in the beginning and helped me pick my dress.' But in 2012, Sandra’s mother lost her battle with cancer and a year later David’s mother Celia also became ill and moved in with Sandra and David. But Sandra wouldn’t let Anne in their house, which reignited the rift. ‘I wouldn’t let her come to my house and see her mum because of all the hurtful thing she’s said to me. 'She could come to take her out but not in the house. 'She made a big deal about that and said that I was trying to replace my mum with her mum and that I was taking her away from her.' Then 20 days before the wedding, the couple received a distressing phone call. David remembers: 'I was lying in bed when the phone rang and Anne said: ""I've got to tell you - you might want to pot the phone on loudspeaker."" 'Then she said: ""I’ve saved you from divorce. I've cancelled your wedding.""' David and Sandra Greatrex at their wedding . Sandra says: 'I was in tears and angry. I wanted to go nuts at her. Everything was paid for so it was a lot of worry. We were up all night. 'I did not think someone was capable of doing that. 'How low can you get? This is your brother getting married. We had paid for everything and I thought she’d ruined it. 'In the morning we rang the registry office and they confirmed that our wedding had been cancelled. 'They said we should come in so they could print everything off for us to give to the police.' Anne had created an email address in Sandra's name to set about jeopardising the couple's plans. Luckily the registry office juggled things around and were able to  fit David and Sandra back in on their planned date. Ann Duffy called Plymouth Register Office 20 days before her brother's wedding and canceled it . Anne was jailed for eight weeks at Plymouth Magistrates' Court. When Sandra reported Anne to the police, Anne admitted it straight away and was given a date to appear in court. But the angry text messages still continued and when the big day arrived, the couple still feared Anne might ruin it. Sandra and David at their wedding . 'We didn’t see her until we got out side,' remembers Sandra of their wedding day. 'We were going to get photos taken when she started shouting commiserations, filming me and putting two fingers up. 'I wish I didn’t have to go through that, but I still had the best day I could have wished for.' At court, Anne pleaded guilty to harassment and was sent to prison. She was jailed for eight weeks at Plymouth Magistrates' Court and was also given a restraining order against Sandra for an indefinite period. David said: 'It was quite upsetting. She got eight weeks but I believe she only did four.' And of Anne's injunction against coming near Sandra, David says: 'It's the best way – the less we see of her the better.' Sandra says: 'It's jealousy bitterness and anger. To this day if she could split us up she would. 'But we’ve been through so much, I don’t think there’s anything out there that could hurt us.' Anne did not want to appear on the programme but said she had her reasons for cancelling the wedding and loved her brother.

9573,"A laser could be mounted on the International Space Station and used to shoot down pieces of space debris in Earth orbit, says a new paper. The system would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth’s atmosphere, where it would burn up. Tokyo researchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS. It would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown). The system would have a range of 62 miles (100km) and could target things less than 0.4 inches (1cm) in size . The paper, by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, was published in Acta Astronautica. Their system would use the Extreme Universe Space Observatory’s (EUSO) super-wide-field telescope on Japan’s Kibo Experiment Module on the ISS. The laser, meanwhile, use bundles of optical fibres to produce powerful laser pulses - capable of both high power and high frequency, although exact figures were not given. Since the first object, Sputnik 1, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of hundreds of thousands of items of debris. The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel. There are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying spaceships and valuable satellites. One major source of debris in the past was a Chinese anti-satellite missile test in 2007 that left an estimated 150,000 pieces of junk in the atmosphere. Accidental events have also contributed to the problem. In 2009 for instance there was a major crash between a U.S. communications satellite and a defunct Russian military probe over Siberia. Combining these two instruments would create a system that could deorbit space debris down to the size of 0.4 inches (one centimetre). The impact of the laser beam on debris would create a force that reduced its velocity, causing it to fall into Earth’s atmosphere and burn up. The group plans to deploy a small proof-of-concept experiment on the ISS, with a small, eight-inch (20-centimetre) version of the EUSO telescope and a laser with 100 fibres. ‘If that goes well, we plan to install a full-scale version on the ISS, incorporating a three-meter [10ft] telescope and a laser with 10,000 fibres, giving it the ability to deorbit debris with a range of approximately 100 kilometers [62 miles],’ said lead researcher Dr Toshikazu Ebisuzaki. Looking further into the future, the team said they could have a ‘free-flyer’ mission not attached to ISS in another orbit to shoot down debris. For example, such a system could be deployed in polar orbit at an altitude of about 500 miles (800km), ‘where the greatest concentration of debris is found,’ according to Dr Ebisuzaki. Without going into specifics, the team says their proposal could remove ‘most’ of the centimetre-sized debris in Earth orbit within five years of operation. MailOnline has asked the researchers to explain how often the laser would fire, and what its maximum capacity in terms of debris-size to deorbit would be. The technology bears some similarities to the Death Star - shown - used to devastating effect in the original Star Wars trilogy. Without going into specifics, the team says their proposal could remove ‘most’ of the centimetre-sized debris in Earth orbit within five years of operation .

Their system would use the Extreme Universe Space Observatory’s (EUSO) super-wide-field telescope on Japan’s Kibo Experiment Module on the ISS (shown) The EUSO telescope was originally planned to detect ultraviolet light from air showers produced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays. But the researchers realised they could put it to another use - the removal of space debris. The fibre-powered laser, meanwhile, was originally developed to power particle accelerators - but again another use for it was found. Space debris, which is continuously accumulating as a result of human space activities, consists of artificial objects orbiting the earth. The number of objects nearly doubled from 2000 to 2014 and they have become a major obstacle to space development. The total mass of space debris is calculated to be about 3,000 tons. It consists of derelict satellites, rocket bodies and parts, and small fragments produced by collisions between debris. ‘We may finally have a way to stop the headache of rapidly growing space debris that endangers space activities,’ added Dr Ebisuzaki.","Tokyo researchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the International Space Station .

6368,"Sweet life: The Duchess of Cornwall . The Duchess of Cornwall has created a buzz with the launch of her own honey, produced in late spring by the bees in her Wiltshire garden. Just 250 jars are being produced, at £20 each, with all proceeds going to charity. But Camilla’s venture reflects a rocketing demand for gourmet honey. Sales of high-end versions are up by 45 per cent at Selfridges since last year. Does luxury honey really taste different enough from ordinary varieties to justify its price tag, though? And how does Camilla’s honey fare against some of its exclusive rivals — including her husband’s Duchy brand? We tested the best-selling gourmet honeys to find out... Duchess of Cornwall Honey . £20 for 227g, Fortnum & Mason . PROMISE: The Duchess’s late-spring honey is made from ‘delicately perfumed nectar with subtle hints of chamomile’ and billed as ‘the ideal accompaniment to ice cream on hot summer days, or for sweetening tea’. All proceeds go to the Medical Detection Dogs charity, of which the Duchess is patron. VERDICT: This tastefully packaged little jar, decorated with a pretty drawing of a pink flower and bee, has a handwritten number on the back. It contains a clear, golden, liquid honey, and when I open the jar a delicate smell of flowers greets my nostrils. When you ooze it over buttered bread, it’s impossible to stop eating. Delicate, delicious and the perfect gift for any honey-lover. A royal winner. 5/5 . Royal winner: Camilla’s honey is made from ‘delicately perfumed nectar with subtle hints of chamomile' Duchy Originals Scottish Heather Honey . £5.10 for 227g, Waitrose . PROMISE: Heathers growing on the Crown Estate in Balmoral produce the nectar for this honey. Beekeepers prize heather honey for its unique taste, and this is a combination of two types of heather, Bell and Ling. VERDICT: Open the jar and just smell the heather aroma before you taste this golden delight. Camilla may have set the bar high but Prince Charles’s answer is also rather beautiful and rare. It has a thick, velvety, sugary texture and a strong but fabulous taste. 3/5 . Duchy Originals Scottish Heather Honey has a thick, velvety, sugary texture and a strong but fabulous taste . Wedderspoon Gold Organic Rata Honey . £14.95 for 325g, wedderspoon.co.uk . PROMISE: Wild Rata trees grow on high land in New Zealand. They flower sporadically, so the nectar is extremely rare. The honey is kept at a low temperature — the same as that of a beehive — to preserve natural enzymes, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. VERDICT: Did you ever think honey could taste like a Christmas tree? Take one gulp of this delicious amber nectar and, seconds later, a subtle taste of pines will dance on your tongue. This creamy, firm-set honey scooped a place in the top 50 products (out of 10,000) in the ‘food Oscars’, the Great Taste Awards. Now I’ve tried it, that comes as no surprise. 4/5 . Wedderspoon Gold Organic Rata Honey scooped a place in the top 50 products in the ‘food Oscars’ Tregothnan Cornish Floral Manuka . £29.95 for 113g, tregothnan.co.uk . PROMISE: Although manuka is generally expensive, this is a more normal-tasting version and Britain’s costliest home-grown honey. Most manuka plants grow in New Zealand but bushes have been growing, hidden behind a garden wall, on the Tregothnan estate in Cornwall since 1880. Bees on the estate feast on these plants as well as on flowers in the deer park and gardens and produce honey in state-of-the-art, six-foot hives, which cost £5,000 each. There is only a limited supply made, hence the hefty price tag. VERDICT: This honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every teaspoon is expensive. Yet it sells out fast each year and has a cult following among honey fans. The jar opens to reveal a light, cream-coloured honey with an almost-white crust. Dip your spoon in to discover solid, set honey which tastes like crystallised sugar. I used a small teaspoon on each dessert for a dinner party and my guests raved about it. A treat for anyone with a sweet tooth. 4/5 . Tregothnan Cornish Floral Manuka honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every spoonful is pricey . Vasilissa Greek Honey with Edible Gold Leaf . £39.99 for 250g, selfridges.co.uk . PROMISE: Produced by hand on a small family farm on the island of Evia, this honey is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling. The small gold flakes are added to honey made from thyme blossom, infusing it with the flavour of the herb. Greek honey is said to be among the best in the world, thanks to the aroma of mountain herbs and flowers, long sunny days and ancient, organic production methods. VERDICT: The shimmering flecks make this an indulgent gift for any honey-lover. It looks so good, I don’t know whether to open the jar or use it as a paperweight. The beautiful white packaging makes it feel extra-special, and when I unscrew the lid the deep aroma is like a glorious perfume. Inside is a smooth, dark-gold honey that tastes like treacle. The experts who hand-make it say the flavour changes subtly each year; they can recognise each one like wine experts identifying a vintage. Tasting this, I can see why they call honey the food of the gods. 5/5 . Vasilissa Greek Honey  is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling . Alemany Rosemary Honey . £7.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk . PROMISE: This is made by a small producer in northern Spain, still using the same traditional methods after five generations. The nectar comes from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains, and the resulting herb-infused honey has a high iron content. It is said to be particularly good for the digestion, and as an aid to relaxation. VERDICT: This is the honey equivalent of a soft-boiled egg. Dip your spoon in for oozing, runny honey in the middle, but enjoy the crunch of the pale, crystallised honey at the sides. It’s very mild — there is no strong aroma and the rosemary flavour is so delicate that you notice it only after several mouthfuls. It does gives a rather surprising aftertaste, though. This is my daughter Ruby’s favourite honey — she describes it as the best of both worlds, for its double consistency. 4/5 . Alemany Rosemary Honey uses nectar from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains . Welsh Chunk Honeycomb Amphora . £21 for 908g, Fortnum & Mason . PROMISE: Clear Welsh honey with a gentle fruity flavour. The delicate honeycomb adds a crumbly texture. Gathered by bees from the wildflowers of meadows and hedgerows in mid-Wales. VERDICT: This looks impressive — a huge glass jar with golden, syrupy honey and a huge, striking honeycomb in the middle, sparkling like a jewel. The Fortnum & Mason label adds to the impression of real quality. What a disappointment, then, to bite into the honeycomb and find that it tastes of earwax. The chewy mass is like old gum. I spit it out — as does my honey-loving son Charlie, who says it tastes no different from the supermarket own-brand honey we usually buy. Proof that paying more doesn’t always guarantee a pot of gold. 1/5 . Heather Honeycomb Starflower Honey . £19.99 for 227g, selfridges.co.uk . PROMISE: The starflower is another name for the borage plant (which sounds much less exotic). But this herbal flower is rich in calcium, vitamin C and potassium. It is used to strengthen adrenal functions, and its oils are prescribed to treat skin diseases. This light and delicate honey comes from Hampshire, and includes heather honeycomb with a hint of herb flavour. VERDICT: You can’t see the chunky honeycomb until you open the lid, because the pale honey that surrounds it isn’t transparent. I’ve never liked the texture of honeycomb myself, but bite into this and breakfast will never be the same again. It crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey (not quite runny but not totally set) unleashes a real taste of the countryside. The jar, with its bright yellow ribbon and artisan label, gives this a real sense of occasion. 4/5 . Heather Honeycomb Starflower Honey crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey unleashes a real taste of the countryside . Chestnut Honey . £6.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk . PROMISE: A dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas. This is formed from the flowers of the chestnut tree, so it has a slightly bitter, savoury aftertaste. A favourite among chefs, who claim that it adds instant depth to dishes. VERDICT: After tasting so many sweet honeys, this one came as a total shock. A dark brown, treacle-tasting honey, it has a wonderful, unmistakable chestnut aroma. My children didn’t like it at all, but I teamed it with cheese and biscuits to serve after a dinner party and the combination was a winner. Perfect if you want something completely different. 3/5 .

1793,"No footballer has ever been late for kick-off because he was tied up negotiating a new contract. So, from the start, Raheem Sterling’s explanation for the end of his conversations with Liverpool did not stand up. It isn’t the talks that are the distraction. It is the thinking. No player is sat in an office haggling over image rights, only to check his watch at 3.30pm and bolt out of the door. A player may feel uncertainty about his future. His brain may whirl over where he will play next season. Liverpool? Arsenal? Abroad? Yet postponing the process to the end of the season doesn’t solve that issue. If anything, it makes it worse. If Sterling wanted to stop thinking right now, he could sign his new deal or tell Liverpool to come back in a year. He has, after all, got more than two seasons left on his existing arrangement. Raheem Sterling has turned down a new deal with Liverpool and put off contract talks until the summer . Sterling (right) has confirmed that he rejected an offer of £100,000-a-week to stay at Liverpool . The 20-year-old gave an interview to the BBC on Wednesday giving his reasons for his decision . So all Sterling did, the day his advisers ended negotiations until May at the earliest, was complicate his affairs. It is not as if he will be able to forget about the decision in the coming weeks, particularly as his stance appears to have damaged his relationship with Liverpool’s supporters. Without doubt, they were dissatisfied with his attitude even before this week’s ill-conceived BBC interview. As Liverpool’s hopes of a Champions League place next season became increasingly remote with the home defeat against Manchester United, Sterling bore the brunt of the dissent. In truth, his performance was little worse than any of his team-mates that day - but he is the one who is seen as disloyal, as rejecting at the first opportunity the club and manager that have best developed his game. Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers have done well by Sterling. They made him a key player in last season’s title near miss, got him to the World Cup. He owes them a little more respect than has been displayed in recent weeks. He owes them enough to know it is downright rude to talk of being flattered by Arsenal just days before the teams meet. Liverpool are entitled to think it is equally flattering for a club of its stature to offer a salary worth more than £5million annually. Apparently not. Sterling (left) shakes hands with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers during training on Thursday . Sterling has played in various positions this season under Rodgers - including as a striker and at wing back . Among the reasons advanced for Sterling’s coldness towards a long-term commitment at Liverpool has been Rodgers’s recent decision to play him at right wing back. This has been a result of injuries and suspensions, rather than a long-term strategy - but it does raise wider questions regarding the mindset of English players, and why many might find their pathway blocked. Would a young player brought up through Ajax’s system, for instance, be so affronted by this temporary change? Why is it the English in particular that see football in straight lines? Sterling has played as a centre forward, a No 10, a wide midfielder and now a wing back. Isn’t this the versatility that we envy in the best foreign teams? Isn’t this an education? Why is it that England produces pigeon-holed full backs or midfielders, and not footballers? Shouldn’t a player - certainly one who wishes to command in excess of £100,000 a week - be able to fill in anywhere? Indeed, shouldn’t he welcome that endorsement from his manager? Arsenal progressed to the 2006 Champions League final at a time when Ashley Cole was injured. In his place through the knockout stages, home and away against Real Madrid, Juventus and Villarreal, was the 22-year-old French midfielder Mathieu Flamini. He hadn’t played full back in his entire professional career, he said. But he never complained, and Arsenal didn’t concede in any of his six matches. Midfielder Mathieu Flamini (right) was used a full back in Arsenal's run to the 2006 Champions League final . Flamini isn’t a creative in Sterling’s mould - but then right wing back isn’t the same as left back, either. Sterling is still operating as a winger when Liverpool attack. Flamini, a central midfielder, was used strictly as a defender. It wasn’t as if Arsene Wenger was gung-ho in those games: three ended goalless, two in 1-0 victories. Flamini performed with exceptional discipline. One imagines that midfielder Emre Can didn’t sign for Liverpool expecting to be part of a back three. Rodgers first used him as a defender this season against Burnley in December, and he has remained there ever since. Can is German, though, the product of a more intellectually vibrant football culture. World Cup-winning captain Philipp Lahm eagerly switched between holding midfield and full back. Midfield lynchpin Bastian Schweinsteiger began his career as a right winger, while Thomas Muller can play centre forward, support striker, attacking midfielder and winger. Every player will have a favourite position but in England these desires become entrenched. Even the most gifted, such as Steven Gerrard, never seemed entirely at ease with his versatility. Maybe Sterling should spend his time thinking less about his contract and more about the type of footballer he wishes to be; maybe about the type of footballer who can demand more than £100,000 a week. Because that player goes wherever his team needs him — and that makes him worth the coin. Sterling's Liverpool team-mate Emre Can (centre) has been used mainly in defence, despite being a midfielder .","Raheem Sterling has turned down an offer of £100,000-a-week to stay at Liverpool .

2500,"Arsenal moved further clear of the two Manchester clubs in second place, and kept the pressure up on leaders Chelsea, as they held on to beat a spirited Burnley at Turf Moor. Arsene Wenger's side were far from their best, but Aaron Ramsey's early goal put them ahead and Burnley, for all their endeavour, didn't create too many clear-cut chances. Here's how Sportsmail rated each player... Burnley . Tom Heaton: Saved well from Ozil in the build-up to Arsenal’s goal but was unfortunate his defenders could not clear. 7 . Kieran Trippier: Forced Ospina into a good save with a curling free-kick and delivered well from corners. 6 . Jason Shackell: At fault for Arsenal’s opener as his sloppy pass gave possession away cheaply. 5.5 . Michael Duff: The 37-year-old did a good job of keeping Giroud under wraps and provided a threat from corners. 6.5 . Ben Mee: Made a superb block to deny Ramsey a second after a brilliant lobbed pass from Ozil. 7 . Ben Mee was booked in the first half for a blatant block on Aaron Ramsey, but responded well . Michael Duff goes up to challenge Arsenal's in-form striker Olivier Giroud during the hard-fought encounter . George Boyd: Full of running as ever but failed to trouble Arsenal when in possession of the ball. 6 . Scott Arfield: Another full of industry and almost provided an assist for Ings with a clever lob. 6 . David Jones: Brought calmness and quality to Burnley’s midfield but could not find a killer pass. 6.5 . Ashley Barnes: Wide left is not his favoured position but put Bellerin under pressure with and intense work ethic. 6 . Danny Ings: Starved action but went close with an acrobatic effort from Arfield’s chip into the box. 6 . Sam Vokes: Saw an early chance go begging when he fired at Ospina from close range. 6 . Subs: Taylor (for David Jones) 90 . George Boyd, who missed a great chance for Burnley on the half-volley, tackles Francis Coquelin . Scott Arfield tries to get to grips with Mesut Ozil as Burnley worked exceptionally hard against Arsenal . Arsenal . David Ospina: Was perhaps busier than he might have expected and had to make decent saves to deny Vokes and Trippier. 7 . Hector Bellerin: Faded after a bright start. Pinned back by Barnes’ aggressive closing down. Nutmegged by Mee. 6 . Laurent Koscielny: Kept a close eye on Danny Ings and restricted the Burnley top-scorer to just one chance. 7 . Per Mertesacker: Given a good, physical battle by Vokes and just about came out on top. 7 . Hector Bellerin is chopped down by Ashley Barnes as Burnley targeted the young Spanish full back . Laurent Koscielny suffered a few difficult moments as Arsenal sought to continue their excellent form . Nacho Monreal: Made a vital interception and clearance to thwart a chance for Ings. 6 . Francis Coquelin: Has developed into a key member of Arsenal’s midfield and did another fine job as the anchor man.7.5 . Mesut Ozil: Less effective than he was against Liverpool, with only flashes of brilliance. 6 . Aaron Ramsey: Applied the finishing touch after a goalmouth scramble to get the Gunners noses in front. 6.5 . Aaron Ramsey fires home to put Arsenal ahead despite several Burnley defenders' best efforts . Santi Cazorla: Left his shooting boots in north London. The Spaniard whipped a free-kick narrowly wide and sent an ambitious left-foot volley over the bar. 6 . Alexis Sanchez: Saw plenty of the ball in the wide left channel but Burnley coped well to nullify the Chilean’s threat. 6 . Olivier Giroud: Marked out of the game by Burnley’s centre-backs and hardly had a kick before being replaced. 5 . Subs: Welbeck for Giroud (81), Chambers for Sanchez (90) Referee: Mike Dean 6.5 . Alexis Sanchez appeals for a free kick in a game where Burnley's tough tackling caused him some problems .

Fenerbahce TV maintained the bus was attacked by an assailant with a shotgun. It said security officers on board quickly took control of the bus and safely stopped it after the driver was hit, averting an accident. None of the players were hurt. Five round marks can be seen on the windscreen of the Fenerbahce team bus after the attack . The window nearest the driver was smashed during the attack on Saturday night .

Caykur Rizespor midfielder Ludovic Obraniak was taken to hospital with a suspected heart problem after being substituted against Fenerbahce . 'The latest situation is that it appears to be a gun,' said Oz. 'It is too soon to say anything definite, but it appears to be a type of bullet fired by a rifle.' Former Liverpool midfielder Dirk Kuyt was among 40 players and officials on board the coach which was attacked near the city of Trabzon. The bus driver suffered a head injury and was taken to hospital. None of the players or club officials were reported to be injured.

3426,"AP McCoy landed the second win of his last Aintree meeting thanks to a trainer he will be praying doesn’t win Saturday's Crabbie’s Grand National. Irishman Gordon Elliott trains Cause of Causes, a gelding owned by McCoy’s boss JP McManus and one of the mounts he could have taken in the race instead of Shutthefrontdoor. McCoy won on board Elliott’s Don Cossack, who took apart a strong Melling Chase field with a 26-length defeat of Cue Card. AP McCoy celebrates after winning the Melling Chase race at Aintree on Friday . McCoy rode Don Cossack to victory as he prepares for his final Grand National on Saturday . Afterwards, Elliott, enjoying his third winner of the meeting and the man who trained 2007 National winner Silver Birch, preferred to concentrate on Don Cossack’s win rather than the National jockey arrangements. Elliott, who has booked Paul Carberry to ride Cause of Causes, said: ‘We have got Paul which is good but if we had AP it would have been twice as good. ‘They make their decisions and we will enjoy today and worry about tomorrow tomorrow.’ A dramatic race saw Balder Succes fall at the third fence and Sire De Grugy come down at the sixth. McCoy settled the matter with a decisive move entering the home straight. Don Cossack’s only defeat in six runs this season came when he did not show his best and ended up third to Uxizandre in the Ryanair Chase at the Cheltenham Festival. Don Cossack ridden by McCoy (second left) leads the field on the way to victory at Aintree . McCoy jumps the final fence on Don Cossack as he rides to victory in the Melling Steeple Chase . Elliott added: ‘Two years ago I said he was the best horse we have ever had. We had a bad season with him but he has proven how good he is. It will be the Gold Cup next season.’ McCoy’s penultimate ride over the Grand National fences ended in disappointment when Eastlake was pulled up in an action-packed Topham Chase in which only 10 of the 30 starters completed. Success went to Nicky Henderson’s Rajdhani Express, who overhauled long-time leader Fairy Rath after the last. It was a sixth win in races over the famous Aintree fences for amateur jockey Sam Waley-Cohen, who rides Oscar Time in today’s big race. Meanwhile, also Gold Cup-bound next season is Paul Nicholls-trained Saphir Du Rheu, 15-length winner of the Grade One Betfred Mildmay Novices’ Chase under Sam Twiston-Davies. Twenty four hours earlier, a second consecutive success for Silviniaco Conti in Thursday’s Betfred Bowl, along with the fact that the gelding has been beaten three times in the Gold Cup, had left Nicholls feeling he did not have a contender for next season but all that has changed now. Nicholls said: ‘After yesterday, I didn’t think we had a Gold Cup horse but we definitely do now. This is a very special horse.’ The day for jockey Brian Hughes had started badly when he took a fall from a hunter while riding as a guest of former Aintree chairman Lord Daresbury, bashing his nose and lip. But it also proved to be a lucky omen. The last time Hughes had ridden out on the Daresbury estate before Aintree, he landed the 2010 Topham Chase on Always Waining. This time he followed it with success on Cyrius Darius in the Grade Two E-Lites Top Novices’ Hurdle. It was a second race win of the meeting for Hughes, who rides outsider Ely Brown in the National. Winning trainer Malcolm Jefferson said: ‘I would love to have a nice two-mile chaser and he could be the one.’ liRISH jockey Robbie McNamara was last night considered very doubtful to take the ride on top weight Lord Windermere after being taken to hospital following a fall in the first race at Wexford. Also, Wayne Hutchinson must receive medical clearance to ride Godsmejudge after he was stood down from his remaining rides yesterday following a fall from Balder Succes in the Melling Chase.","McCoy won on board Elliott's Don Cossack, who took apart a strong Melling Chase field with a 26-length defeat of Cue Card .

7123,"The parents of a five-year-old transgender boy are sharing their son’s story with the world in a bid to prove that there is no such thing as being ‘too young’ to identify as transgender. Massachusetts couple Mimi and Joe Lemay's son Jacob wasn't always a boy. The five-year-old was born Mia, the second of three sisters. But from a very early age, Jacob began rejecting his gender. And after years of questioning how to handle his preferences, before finally coming to terms with what their son wanted, the Lemays explained to NBC News that they decided to let their child assume the identity of a boy. Scroll down for video. Boys will be boys: Mimi and Joe Lemay's five-year-old son Jacob was born a girl named Mia, but the couple has now accepted that their child is a boy . Mimi and Joe began to notice that Jacob was having difficulties when he was a toddler. Then named Mia, he would insist on changing his clothes 10 to 12 times a day, in an attempt to find something he felt comfortable in, before his parents bought him a blue 'doggy sweater' that he wore for six months straight - often over girlier dresses and tutus. The couple assumed they were just raising a tomboy. 'She would take on ""boy"" personas, and just always want to play with boy things,' said Joe. 'Her need to play boy roles, and her need to be seen or spoken to as a boy at home became very persistent,' added Mimi. Then, shortly before he turned three, Jacob declared himself a boy. Happy family: Jacob was born the second of three daughters in the Massachusetts-based Lemay family . Finding the right wardrobe: From a young age, Jacob (R) preferred to wear boy clothes; when his parents still dressed him as a girl, the frustrated toddler would change outfits up to 12 times a day . Mimi said that she  was worried that Jacob's behavior would make it harder for him to build relationships - already, he had trouble relating to his peers - and she hoped her child's desire to be a boy would go away. In the meantime, she and Joe made allowances while Jacob wasn't in public. Home became a 'battleground over gender', Mimi wrote in a letter to Jacob on his fifth birthday, which was published by The Synapse, continuing that they decided to let Jacob cut his hair, wear boy clothes, and assume aspects of his male identity at home. While this made things easier when just family was around - his older sister eventually stopped teasing him about not being a 'real boy' - things were still hard at school, where Jacob didn't engage with his classmates. Jacob's parents explained that their son's behavior wasn't just that of a typical tomboy. Not content to just 'pretend' to be a boy, Jacob, then still called Mia, hated her body and would say things like: 'Why did god make me this way? Why did god make me wrong?' Trying to fit in: While he was still perceived as a girl, Jacob would only open up around his family and had trouble getting along with his peers . Accepting his identity: The Lemays eased into Jacob's transition, slowly allowing him to wear boy clothes, cut his hair short, and refer to himself as a boy at home . Mimi and Joe saw a glimpse of their future on an April 2014 trip to Disney World. They let Jacob wear a Prince Charming costume, and when strangers called him handsome he 'just glowed'. His mother said persistence, consistence, and insistence are the hallmarks of a possibly transgender child - and Jacob was demonstrating all three. In June 2014, the Lemays sat Jacob down and showed him a video about another transgender boy, Ryland Whittington. Tears in her eyes, Mimi told him: 'All we want is for you to be happy, but we need help to understand what will make you happy.' Joe asked Jacob if he wanted to be like Ryland and have everyone know he's a boy. 'I can't,' Jacob told them. 'I have to be Mia at school.' His parents told him that if he wanted to, he could start attending a new school in the fall. Jacob was elated, telling them, 'I want to be a boy always.' The Lemays began to let Jacob transition. Playing the prince: On a trip to Disney World last year, Jacob (pictured right with his sister Ella) was thrilled when strangers mistook him for a boy in his Prince Charming Costume . Happy kid: Since transitioning, Jacob has come into his own; he socializes and shows affection more since he has started to feel more like himself . Mimi says she and her husband didn't expect the 'seismic shift' in Jacob's behavior and personality that they experienced, but the boy completely came out of his shell. He immediately became more social, more affectionate, and more interested in picking up hobbies. 'He's just a different person. He's becoming himself,' said Joe. Watching how the change has affected Jacob has allowed his parents to see Jacob as he sees himself. 'I realized he had never really been Mia,' Mimi said. 'That had been a figment of my imagination.' The Lemays hope that coming forward to talk about their experience will help Jacob grow up in a society where there's a better perception of transgender people.","Mimi and Joe Lemay's son Jacob was born Mia, the second of three sisters .

1780,"It is just 12 weeks since bold claims were emanating from an ultra-confident Dundee United dressing room that this season could yield an unprecedented domestic Treble. ‘I believe we can win all three trophies,’ trumpeted goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak. ‘People might laugh at me but maybe in May we will have won the league and cups and I will be laughing.’ On Wednesday night against Dundee at Dens Park, however, those carefree early January days seemed so long ago as Cierzniak’s grip of the ball for Greg Stewart’s opening goal proved as tight as his grasp on footballing reality. Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara is under pressure following his side's recent slump . Dundee United failed to get their hands on the Scottish League Cup  as they fell to a 2-0 defeat by Celtic . Scottish Premiership outfit Dundee United have failed to win any of their last 10 games . As United slumped to a first derby defeat in 11 years, the loss at Dens Park saw Jackie McNamara’s team make it 10 matches without a win. It’s not yet May but nobody is laughing at Tannadice as the club gets to grips with an implosion of cataclysmic proportions both on and off the park. It does seem a touch bizarre that all is not well at a club that has reached back-to-back domestic cup finals for the first time in 29 years; qualified for European competition in three of the last four years; finished in the Premiership top six in every one of the last seven years and won the Scottish Cup in 2010. Yet as United have dropped like a stone from early-season table-toppers to potentially even missing out on Europe, the fallout has come amid an increasingly acrid war of words surrounding revelations about McNamara’s entitlement to a cut from outgoing player sales. Those close to Tannadice speak of a series of damaging schisms developing on all sides between fans, board and manager; cumulatively casting increased uncertainty over McNamara’s future. Ahead of the annual general meeting of influential supporters’ group ArabTRUST, one leading fan told Sportsmail of ‘overwhelming unhappiness’ with McNamara’s bonus, while his recruitment and tactical nous are also being questioned. There is, he added, a growing belief among fans that the manager’s position is ‘untenable’. But this has been a slow-burning civil war. The seeds of the crisis that appear to have taken place at almost every level of the club were first sown at the end of the winter transfer window when chairman Stephen Thompson took the unpopular decision to sell star players Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven to Celtic. As furious fans pointed out, hadn’t Thomson used the eve of last May’s Scottish Cup Final defeat by St Johnstone to declare Tannadice finances to be their finest since 1986 and vow there would be no player exodus, as occurred after the Scottish Cup win in 2010 under Peter Houston? Dundee United sold Stuart Armstrong (left) to Celtic during the January transfer window . Gary Mackay-Steven also sealed a winter move to Celtic on transfer deadline day . The Tannadice supremo even went as far as name-checking Armstrong along with Ryan Gauld and Andrew Robertson as players he would like to keep for ‘at least another year’ to help ‘compete’ with Celtic. Gauld and Robertson were quickly sold for £3million each last summer, although the fees for both made the sales palatable. Yet parting with Armstrong and Mackay-Steven just 48 hours after reaching a League Cup Final against a Celtic side Thompson had vowed to ‘compete’ with proved particularly painful for the rank and file. ‘I thought it was a strange decision, I must admit,’ said former United defender and BBC analyst Mark Wilson recently. ‘I can understand letting Mackay-Steven go because he had signed a pre-contract with Celtic but Armstrong is a different case. ‘United were in touching distance of Celtic and if you are serious about challenging, then you can sell him in June. ‘I read McNamara saying he wanted to keep both players but that they needed to balance the books. But they sold Gauld and Robertson for substantial fees in the summer and I read the chairman talking about how great the club’s finances are. ‘It was just a bit odd. Especially selling to Celtic, a rival, rather than an English team.’ At first, United closed ranks to slap down their detractors, reacting with an almost weary derision to anyone questioning the wisdom of selling key players at such a crucial part of the season. Dundee United striker Ryan Dow has scored just two league goals during the course of the current season . Dundee United striker Nadir Ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper Scott Bain . After starting life post-Armstrong and Mackay-Steven with a comprehensive 3-0 Scottish Cup victory at Stranraer, the line spun was that the two players, while talented, did not constitute a two-man team. They were at pains to point out that as United stormed to the top of the Premiership at the start of the season, Armstrong was often injured while an off-form Mackay-Steven was regularly left on the bench. Indeed, it was argued that, together, the duo started just three of United’s first nine games of the campaign, of which McNamara’s side won seven, drew one and lost one. After that Stair Park victory, two-goal Ryan Dow was hailed as the man to step into Armstrong and Mackay-Steven’s goalscoring boots. Dow has not hit the net since. Worryingly, United then slumped to their first back-to-back defeats of the season and went on to lose the League Cup Final to Celtic. Bain refuses to react as the Turkish striker does his best to rile his rival goalkeeper at Den Park . Turkish forward Ciftci celebrates with a kiss but ends up blushing as his side lose derby match . Jake McPake wheels away in celebration as helps Dundee earn first derby win in over a decade . Over the course of four March meetings with Ronny Deila’s men, United were dispatched from the Scottish Cup and defeated in the league, too, as McNamara’s season started to disintegrate. As the heat rose on Thompson, the United chairman first admitted the sales were a wrong footballing decision but correct from a financial standpoint. Curiously, though, the spotlight would then eventually turn on McNamara as ArabTRUST and the Federation of Dundee United Supporters’ Clubs released a statement saying they were shocked 25 per cent of £6.3m worth of transfer fees for Gauld, Robertson, Armstrong and Mackay-Steven were paid in commission to unnamed parties. United continue to deny the figures in question but eventually made the bombshell confirmation that McNamara was indeed entitled to a cut of player transfers. Even if it was done with the best of intentions — to reduce the manager’s salary in straitened times while bumping his earnings up if successful in developing young talent to sell — the revelation was toxic in the eyes of many fans. Their new-found ire towards a manager who led them to two consecutive finals has been further roused by United losing five-in-a-row for the first time since May 2006. Amid this poor run, St Johnstone defender Frazer Wright recently claimed that if McNamara’s men fall behind, ‘it gets in their heads’ and they ‘argue amongst themselves’. Dundee Utd goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak looks back at his goal after Mark Stewart opened the scoring . Stewart celebrates his derby goal with a fan as he runs over to the home faithful at Den Park . Defeat at Tannadice against hapless Hamilton — without a win in 12 games — is now rendered unthinkable, even if victory would clinch a top-six finish for city rivals Dundee. There are those within Dens Park who sense a real opportunity to become the first Dark Blues side to finish above United in the league since 2002-03. A loss, coupled with a win for on-form Dundee at St Johnstone, would see Paul Hartley’s men go above United in the table on Saturday. Few could have guessed that scenario when, in the first hours of 2015, United took Dundee apart in a record 6-2 derby win at Tannadice. Not least Paul Heffernan, who, as a Hibs player, was impressed by United in a thrilling 3-3 draw at Easter Road in the League Cup in October before McNamara’s side sneaked through on penalties. ‘I’m sure the fans would love us to finish above United — and it’s all to play for,’ said the Irish striker, who scored the third in Dundee’s 3-1 win at Dens on Wednesday night. ‘We’re only two points behind United now, so we’ve just got to keep going when the split comes. Dundee United's Chris Erskine goes down under a challenge from Stephen McGinn during the Dundee derby . Dundee's Paul Heffernan taps home his side's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory . ‘I’m surprised that they have gone 10 games without a win. When I was still at Hibs earlier this season, we played them in the League Cup and they were a very good side. ‘It’s a long time not to win but they’ve still got very good players in the team. I’m sure they will come good again. ‘I’d actually like it if they came good against Hamilton on Saturday, though. That would be perfect because it would cement our place in the top-six. ‘So here’s hoping they can turn it around on Saturday because it would help us. It would be ironic, I know, if United clinched us a top-six place. ‘But we go to St Johnstone knowing we are definitely in the top six if we win there.’ While the tangerine half of Dundee mourns its fall from grace, the Dark Blues are in raptures after breaking a sequence of derbies without victory stretching back to November 2004. ‘Ending that run against United was a big motivating factor — and I felt that was the best I’ve seen us play,’ said Heffernan. ‘A lot of the players haven’t been here that long. But, for the sake of the fans who haven’t witnessed a win over United for such a long time, it was really important. We did it for them. I’m sure they will enjoy this one for a long time to come.’ After a long era in the shadow of their neighbours, Dundee are daring to dream. Amid a tangerine nightmare, however, for a United side in crisis, the Treble that once lay ahead has been replaced by trouble.","Dundee United lost 2-0 to Celtic at Dens Park on Wednesday night .

2124,"Hillary Clinton's 'Everyday Americans' video has been given an 18 rating by a Russian television network - because it features two men holding hands. Dozhd TV, an independent network, fears the video launching Clinton's White House bid may fall foul of Putin's 'gay propaganda' laws - which allows the imposition heavy fines for promoting homosexuality to people under the age of 18. Clinton's video not only features Democrat campaigners Jared Milrad and Nate Johnson, from Chicago, Illinois, holding hands, but talking about their up-coming wedding. Restricted: A Russian television network has given Hillary Clinton's video an 18 rating because it features a gay couple, who are planning a summer wedding, holding hands . Equality: Jared Milrad (pictured right) and his fiancé Nate Johnson, were delighted to be included in the video, saying it showed off the changing attitudes of the U.S. Milrad's voice is heard in a voiceover saying: 'I’m getting married this summer to someone I really care about.' The inclusion of the segment has won widespread support, and highlights Clinton's own stand on equality. Milrad himself has said he  was overjoyed to be part of the Clinton roll out - and part of a large-scale change in U.S. social attitudes. 'It shows how far we've come,' said Milrad, a 31-year-old lawyer and social activist, pleased that public support for same-sex marriage rights has grown so far as to appear in a presidential campaign launch. But it is at odds with Russia's view on LGBT rights, which have become increasingly restrictive during Vladimir Putin's presidency. However, Dozhd, an opposition network, told ABC News it had acted before being instructed by the Russian government. If they had aired it without the warning, the company could have faced a fine of as much as £13,200 under 2013's gay propaganda laws. Dozhd is not the only company to take preemptive action like this: in March, Ikea pulled its online magazine IKEA Family Live, which 'demonstrates various aspects of home life regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation'. The Swedish retailer decided to remove it as there was a risk 'some material in our magazine can be considered as propaganda'. Backwards: But while the U.S. may be becoming more inclusive, Russia has recently been putting in place more repressive laws as the government becomes increasingly anti LGBT rights . Fine: Opposition television network Dozhd decided to give it the rating to avoid getting a £13,200 fine . Differing views: Putin (left) and Clinton (right) are on other sides of the divide when it comes to LGBT rights - with the former First Lady being a staunch supporter of equality . But it is not just the U.S. and Russia as countries which are at odds with each other: Putin and Clinton hold very differing views personally as well. Speaking in 2014, Putin claimed there was a need to 'clean up' homosexuality in Russian order to drive up the country's birth rate, and defended the country's right to pass such a law. The Russian leader - who claims he has gay friends - has gone as far as to link gay people to pedophiles in the past. Meanwhile, the same year Putin signed the gay propaganda law into being, Secretary of State Clinton had publicly come out in support of gay marriage. 'LGBT Americans are our colleagues, our teachers, our soldiers, our friends, our loved ones, and they are full and equal citizens and deserve the rights of citizenship- that includes marriage,' she said in the video. 'I support it personally and as a matter of policy and law. 'Like so many others, my personal views have been shaped over time by people I have known and loved, by my experience representing our nation on the world's stage, my devotion to law and human rights, and the guiding principles of my faith.' Clinton also has a lot of support within the LGBT community, with the nation's largest lesbian political action committee launching Lesbians4Hillary to support her bid for the White House. Lesbians4Hillary, co-chaired by pioneering tennis great Billie Jean King, said: 'Hillary Clinton is a proven leader and she has a strong track record when it comes to inclusion -- specifically for women and the LGBTQ community.'","Dozhd TV, an independent network, fears the video launching Clinton's White House bid may fall foul of Putin's 'gay propaganda' laws .

9568,"A man  who fled to South Africa in the hope of a better life has been brutally murdered by a mob who are believed to have attacked him purely because he came from Mozambique. Shocking images capture the moment the armed gang surround Emmanuel Sithole and repeatedly stab him with knives and bludgeon him with a wrench in Alexandra township near Johannesburg. In a chilling twist the victim was left bleeding to death in a gutter because a medical centre just 300 feet away was closed for the day because the doctor who worked there was also a foreigner and feared becoming a victim of a xenophobic attack himself. Doctors tried in vain to save Mr Sithole's life. His cause of death was later established as a direct stab wound to the heart and his identity established from a mobile phone found in his pocket . Attack: Shocking images capture the moment the armed gang surround Emmanuel Sithole and repeatedly stab him with knives and bludgeon him with a wrench in Alexandra township near Johannesburg . Sick: As Emmanuel Sithole lay injured in the gutter another thug saw what was going on and joined in the attack using a knife to stab him repeatedly while the first attacked continued to beat him with the wrench . The brutal attack was captured on camera on Saturday morning by a journalist from South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper who was in the neighbourhood to interview a number of foreign-born shopkeepers who'd had their businesses looted overnight. But as children played in the streets and onlookers stopped to inspect the damage from the previous evening, the Mozambique-born passer-by was brutally attacked without warning by a man carrying a metal wrench. As Mr Sithole sat injured in the gutter another thug saw what was going on and joined in the attack using a knife to stab him repeatedly while the first attacked continued to beat him with the wrench. A third attacker - wearing a grey hoodie - then reportedly entered the fray, running over and kicking Mr Sithole in the head as he pulled out a large butcher's knife. Before he had the chance to use the knife a witness intervened and the three men fled the scene. It was too late for Mr Sithole, however, who managed to stumble along the road pleading for help for his fatal injuries before collapsing fatally injured in a rubbish-strewn gutter. Under siege: The brutal attack was captured on camera on Saturday morning by a journalist from South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper who was in the neighbourhood to interview a number of foreign-born shopkeepers who'd had their businesses looted overnight . Beaten: As children played in the streets and onlookers stopped to inspect the damage from the previous evening, the Mozambique-born passer-by was brutally attacked without warning by a man carrying a metal wrench . Savage: Another thug saw what was going on and joined in the attack using a knife to stab Emmanuel Sithole repeatedly . Witnesses, including the  journalist, took Mr Sithole in the back of a car to a nearby medical centre but found it was closed because the foreign-born duty doctor had failed to turn up for his shift because he feared being attacked by the xenophobic hordes rampaging through the township. During the subsequent journey to a hospital, Mr Sithole's condition deteriorated as he screamed and winced in agony before he eventually fell unconscious. Porters initially refused to take the man into the hospital as he appeared to be dead but, after spotting him choking he was rushed inside the building where doctors tried in vain to save his life. The cause of death was later established as a direct stab wound to the heart and his identity established from a mobile phone found in his pocket. Following the attack, fearful immigrants in South Africa revealed they had been targeted  by longtime neighbors and people who warned they would assault anyone carrying a foreign passport. The immigrants spoke at a tent camp where they are now living having fled Alexandra when the mobs began attacking shops owned by those from other African countries. Harrowing: A third attacker  then entered the fray, running over and kicking Mr Sithole in the head as he pulled out a large butcher's knife . Brave: Before the man had the chance to use the large knife, a witness intervened and the three attackers fled the scene . The violence in Alexandra township followed anti-immigrant riots in and around the coastal city of Durban that killed at least six people, recalling a bout of similar unrest in South Africa in 2008 in which about 60 people died. The message from the mobs in Alexandra was, 'We don't want to see people with passports. We only want to see people with South African IDs,' said Veronica Lechaea, who comes from the southern African country of Lesotho and has lived in South Africa since 2008. Lechaea, who works as an office cleaner in Johannesburg, left her home in Alexandra and sought refuge in a camp set up on the grounds of an Anglican church by the charity Gift of the Givers. She said she makes about $250 a month and sends half of the money home to Lesotho to support her 12-year-old son, who is living there with his grandparents. The attacks stem from a perception that immigrants are taking jobs at the expense of South Africans in a country with high unemployment. Many people from other countries have entered South Africa illegally, though the government has said a large number are working legally and contributing to economic development. Some African countries are arranging to repatriate their fearful citizens, and there have been protests and calls in Malawi, Zimbabwe and other regional nations for a boycott of South African goods. Dying: Witnesses took Mr Sithole in the back of a car to a nearby medical centre but found it was closed because the foreign-born duty doctor had failed to turn up for his shift because he feared being attacked by the xenophobic hordes rampaging through the township . Fatally wounded: In a chilling twist the victim was left bleeding to death in a gutter because the a medical centre just 300 feet away was closed for the day because the doctor who worked there was also a foreigner and feared becoming a victim of a xenophobic attack himself . During the subsequent journey to hospital, Mr Sithole's condition deteriorated as he screamed in agony before eventually falling unconscious . South Africa has one of the biggest economies in Africa and it is unclear whether any boycott would have a significant impact. Immigrants from Asia and the Middle East have also been affected by the violence in South Africa. Sandra Ngwanya, a chicken seller from Zimbabwe who also left her Alexandra home for the Gift of the Givers camp, said her neighbors told her: ''We are going to go door to door, taking your stuff and beating you. So we want you to go back to your country.'' Ngwanya, who has lived in South Africa since 2006 and married a South African, said she left her two young children with cousins and hoped to go home soon. 'They are saying it's quiet. The police are all over the place. I want to go and check on our stuff,' said Ngwanya, whose husband works in a mine outside Johannesburg and planned to return to check on his family. However, some people at the camp said the situation remained volatile.","Emmanuel Sithole was attacked by a mob in Alexandra township near Johannesburg .

9014,"With superfans already eagerly camped out at St. Mary's Hospital ahead of Kate Middleton's due date, it seems that the birth of Prince George in 2013 did nothing to diminish the undeniable global fascination surrounding royal babies. And it's not just Brits that are starting to make excited estimations, the frenzy has reached America where there are more than a few guesses about royal baby particulars. International research firm, YouGov, has conducted a poll asking the UK and the US their opinions on the second child, and it turns out, views are not too different. Scroll down for video . William and Kate are currently prepping for the birth of the second royal baby, which has spurred guesses on the sex and name . Questioning 1713 Brits and 1124 Americans, the survey revealed that after the excitement of a baby boy in blue in 2013, this time around, both desire a baby girl. In fact, this landslide opinion was only contested by two per cent of Brits and seven per cent of Americans, who alternatively want Prince George to have a baby brother. When it comes down to a name for William and Kate's potential little girl, the survey revealed discrepancies between what Brits and Americans want. In the UK, Charlotte, Alice and Alexandra are the leading names, with Charlotte scooping the lead with 13 per cent. Americans instead favour distinctively prominent royal names, with the top three being Diana at 19 per cent, and Elizabeth and Victoria tying at 12 per cent in terms of popularity. The 2013 birth of Prince George did nothing to diminish the undeniable global fascination surrounding royal babies, with many having placed bets on the sex and name of the second child . Princess Diana was the much-celebrated first wife of Prince Charles, and also the mother of Prince William, before passing away in 1997. The popularity of the name Elizabeth is most likely derived from the name of the current queen, Elizabeth II. Similarly, the popularity of the name Victoria, is from Queen Victoria, whose reign of nearly 64 years is the longest of any other British monarch. When it comes down the names for a potential baby boy, the survey revealed much more unified results. Both Brits and Americans agree on James, Richard and Arthur as their favourite top three boy names, with James scooping the lead, at 27 per cent in the UK and 15 per cent in the US, in terms of popularity. Americans have picked Diana and Elizabeth as their favourite names if the royal baby is in fact a girl. The popularity of these names could have stemmed from prominent names of other royals, including the late Princess Diana (pictured left) and Queen Elizabeth II (pictured right) And it's not only immediate particulars about the unborn baby's life being discussed; people were also keen to throw in their two cents about the most suitable roles for the child's later life. Both were in agreement that in the future, baby number two should focus on acting as a good role model for young people. Opinions divided when it came to the second most important role.While Brits believe the second child of William and Kate should also prioritise having a job, Americans feel that the next priority should be raising money for charity. Although American are showing some interest in the new royal baby, the majority of the US are far less interested in the latest arrival, in comparison to Prince George's birth in 2013. A poll by YouGov revealed that both Brits and Americans want royal baby number two to be a girl (picture posed by model) According to a new survey by the University Of Southern California, American are five times less interested in the new royal baby than they were with George. Jeetendr Sehdev, professor of marketing at USC, told the Sunday Times:  'They were three times more interested in the birth of Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake's baby and equally excited by the [forthcoming] birth of Sophie Hunter and Benedict Cumberbatch's child. 'Only one in 10 Americans describe themselves as excited about the second royal baby. Some of this is inevitable but it also represents a wider attitudinal shift across the US. 'Americans still love Great Britain ... but the royals are now part of that, not the face of it.'","The birth of Prince George in 2013 did nothing to diminish the undeniable global fascination surrounding royal babies .

The Italian, who spent four years in prison after previously being found guilty of the murder of Surrey-born Meredith, 21, in 2007, is said to be looking at compensation. The 31-year-old was spotted out and about with a blonde companion this week looking through the lingerie section of a shop in Rome, Italy - days after he was seen looking at a £105,000 BMW at a car dealership in the city.

He later described the ruling as an 'end to the nightmare' telling a press conference that he needed 'time to heal' and 'time to breathe this fresh air'.

Both Knox and Sollecito (right) are reportedly planning to seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison . While no figures have been revealed, compensation for such cases regularly run into seven figure sums. Sollecito's lawyer Giulia Bongiorno revealed her client would wait for Italy's top court to give the reasoning behind the acquittal, expected later this year, before taking a decision. Knox's lawyer, confirmed Miss Knox will 'be seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment,' according to The Telegraph. Arline Kercher, Meredith's mother, described the acquittal ruling as 'odd'. Raffaele Sollecito (pictured left with a blonde companion) described his acquittal last month as an 'end to the nightmare' The 31-year-old told a press conference last month that he needed 'time to heal' and 'time to breathe this fresh air' Raffaele Sollecito is pictured with a companion leaving a clothes shop in the Italian capital, Rome . She said: '(I am) a bit surprised, and very shocked, but that is about it at the moment. They have been convicted twice so it's a bit odd that it should change now.' Her daughter, who was 21 and from Coulsdon, Surrey, was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 while studying in Perugia, Italy. Seattle-born Miss Knox, 27, who was Ms Kercher's flat-mate, and Mr Sollecito, spent four years in jail for the murder but were acquitted on appeal in 2011. But Italy's highest court last month overturned the 2014 convictions and declined to order another trial.

Mererith Kercher (pictured) from Coulsdon, Surrey, was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 while studying in Perugia, Italy . The decision by the Supreme Court of Cassation is the final ruling in the seven-year case and definitively ends the gruelling legal battle. The pair always maintained their innocence. Both Sollecito and Knox were imprisoned shortly after Kercher's body was discovered with 47 separate wounds on November 1, 2007. They were originally convicted of murder and sexual assault in December 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in jail respectively. After they served four years in prison a court in Perugia threw out their convictions and declared them innocent. A view of the house where British student Kercher was killed. It is understood Knox will go back to Italy to write a book about the country's legal system . Knox and Sollecito were pictured embracing as police searched the house immediately after Kercher's death . Knox returned to the US before another U-turn in the sensational case in January last year when a court in Florence reinstated the original 2009 conviction and increased Knox's sentence to 28-and-a-half years. Judge Gennaro Marasca read the decision to finally acquit the pair in late March after a judicial body had deliberated for ten hours. Rudy Guede is now the only person to be successfully convicted of the murder. The unemployed basketball player was found guilty in October 2008 and was convicted to 16 years after his footprints were discovered in Kercher's blood.

8179,"Accused: Dr Ram Manohar, 38, of Barnston, Wirral, has denied four counts of sexual assault . A senior doctor facing sexual assault allegations from two separate nurses is accused of groping the breast of one of them and saying 'you bad girl' after smacking her on the bottom. A&E consultant Dr Ram Manohar, 38, is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital. David McLachlan, prosecuting, said Manohar offered to help Nurse A with her training on December 23, 2013, Liverpool Crown Court heard. He said she knew Manohar and, while in his room, asked for his help to learn about matters including chest X-rays. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any warning Ram Manohar put his hand down her nurse's dress and he put his hands into her bra.' She said he moved his hand around but she had not asked for a demonstration. Nurse A said he later asked her a question about the heart, which she got wrong. She said: 'He smacked me on the bottom quite hard and said to me, ""you bad girl"".' Mr McLachlan said Manohar squeezed her left breast to indicate where her left ventricle was and while discussing breast lumps asked to see her nipple, but she refused. She said the conversation moved onto the femoral pulse. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any word of warning he put his hand up her dress and down her tights.' Manohar then allegedly touched her inappropriately. Nurse A said he told her 'this type of teaching is only for you' before she left the room 'feeling disgusted with herself'. She later told friends she felt 'violated' before contacting police. Manohar told officers he had known her since working with her at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. He said after a night out she had asked him back to her house, but he had refused. He said she had also asked him on December 12 'to find her a single and smart man because she was desperate'. Manohar said on December 23 she unzipped her top, making him uncomfortable, and followed him around 'like a puppy'. The doctor denied touching her inappropriately and said his office door had been open. He said she had been pointing to different parts of her body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive'. Manohar is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital (pictured). Nurse A said he groped her breast after she asked him about chest X-rays . Nurse B alleged that Manohar touched her inappropriately on July 10 and October 31, 2013. She said the first time she went to A&E because she had pins and needles in her hands and feet. Nurse B said he examined and touched her genital area. However, she said she thought he had been professional and thanked him before he gave her a hug. She said on October 31 she saw him about a 'very bad headache' and he treated her in a dark room, checking her reflexes before touching her genital area. The A&E consultant claims he had been pointing to different parts of Nurse A's body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive' Nurse B again thought he had acted professionally and went to the hospital to drop off a thank you card. She said he invited her to meet him for coffee and she went to the hospital for 'a coffee type date' because she did not know he was married. Nurse B alleged Manohar invited her into his office, kissed her, told her how beautiful she was and suddenly without warning put his hand into her knickers. Mr McLachlan said: 'She stopped him straightaway. He told her that he was married with children.' Nurse B also reported him to the police. Manohar told officers he did not inappropriately touch her during either examination. He said she told him she had feelings for him but he said he was married and she started crying. Manohar admitted he then kissed her but said he did not think he had put his hand into her knickers. He said: 'I think she caught my hand and put it on top of her trousers or something.'

425,"(CNN)Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have always been thorny, but rarely has the state of affairs been as venomous as it is today. Tehran and Riyadh each point to the other as the main reason for much of the turmoil in the Middle East. In its most recent incarnation, the Iranian-Saudi conflict by proxy has reached Yemen in a spiral that both sides portray as climatic. For Riyadh and its regional allies, the Saudi military intervention in Yemen -- ""Operation Decisive Storm"" -- is the moment the Sunni Arab nation finally woke up to repel the expansion of Shia-Iranian influence. For Tehran and its regional allies -- including the Houthi movement in Yemen -- Saudi Arabia's actions are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable. And yet both sides have good reasons to want to stop the Yemeni crisis from spiraling out of control and evolving into an unwinnable war. When Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was elected in June 2013, he pledged to reach out to Riyadh. He was up front and called Tehran's steep deterioration of relations with the Saudis over the last decade as one of the principal burdens on Iranian foreign policy. From Lebanon and Afghanistan to Pakistan and the Gaza Strip, the Iranian-Saudi rivalry and conflict through proxy has been deep and costly. And yet despite Rouhani's open pledge, profound differences over Syria and Iraq in particular have kept Riyadh and Tehran apart. But if the questions of Syria and Iraq prevented a pause in hostilities, the Saudi military intervention in Yemen since late March has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels. Unlike in Syria and in Iraq, the Saudi military is now directly battling it out with Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen. While Riyadh no doubt exaggerates Tehran's role in the Yemen crisis, its fingerprints are nonetheless evident. ""Iran provides financial support, weapons, training and intelligence to Houthis,"" Gerald Feierstein, a U.S. State Department official and former Yemen ambassador, told a Congressional hearing last week. ""We believe that Iran sees opportunities with the Houthis to expand its influence in Yemen and threaten Saudi and Gulf Arab interests."" The Iranians find the charges biased and point to the Saudi airstrikes in Yemen as a much bigger case of meddling in a neighbor's affairs. In Iran, the cue came from the country's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been unusually blunt. He tweeted: ""Despite disputes, the Saudis used to display composure [with] us but now inexperienced youngsters have come to power & replaced composure [with] barbarism."" Three days after Khamenei's speech, Iran suspended religious pilgrimages to Mecca. This came as news broke about two Iranian teenage boys who had reportedly been sexually assaulted by the police while visiting Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, anti-Saudi protests have been staged in a number of Iranian cities. Khamenei's speech opened the floodgate of anti-Saudi statements. The voices of hardline figures in Tehran have been the most agitated. General Ahmad Purdastan, the commander of the Iranian ground forces, taunted the Saudis. ""Beware of the day when firecrackers explode in Riyadh,"" Purdastan said, in a not-so-subtle warning. But it was not only the hawks that came out swinging against the Saudis. Ayatollah Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president and arguably Iran's most vocal advocate of better Iranian-Saudi relations. called Riyadh's military intervention a ""strategic mistake"" and urged for a political solution. Seeking a political solution is Iran's stated aim for the Yemeni crisis, but the prospects of such an effort succeeding are slim. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has provided a four-point plan: to get a ceasefire, to encourage the provision of humanitarian aid, to promote political dialogue among warring Yemeni parties, and to achieve the formation of an inclusive government. But the Iranian proposal also asks for an end to Saudi airstrikes. As Zarif put it, ""Iran and Saudi Arabia need to talk, but we cannot talk to determine the future of Yemen."" The Saudis have thus far ignored the Iranian proposal. Meanwhile, the Houthi leadership has welcomed the plan. As one of its leaders said, ""In Iran's plan, unacceptable solutions do not exist."" Not only do the Saudis not have any faith in any Iranian-drafted political package that is welcomed by the Houthis, but Riyadh believes that the international disposition favors it. Saudi Arabia was elated by the U.N. Security Council vote on 14 April that condemned the Houthi movement. Only Russia abstained. But a solution to the Yemeni crisis will not come from the U.N. The U.N. can provide a cover for Riyadh's military intervention, but it cannot secure it a military win. This leaves Riyadh with a fundamental question about how far it is willing to take its fight in Yemen. Saudi airstrikes alone will not finish off the Houthi movement and it allies in the Yemeni armed forces. It requires ground troops on a huge scale. Riyadh has tried hard to muster a military coalition that is willing to dispatch ground troops but its effort has so far been nothing short of a fiasco. The Pakistanis most famously turned down the Saudi request and let it be known that Yemen is a quagmire they can do without. Instead, Islamabad has asked Iran to push the Houthis for a political compromise that Riyadh can live with. The Turks were enthusiastic at first about stopping the Houthis -- but in his visit to Tehran last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made it clear that he has prioritized Iranian-Turkish trade relations over rivalry in Yemen, and emphasized a political solution for the Yemeni conflict. The Egyptians and the Jordanians are still supportive of Saudi efforts and claim publicly to be open to the idea of deploying military forces to assist Riyadh in Yemen. But whether they will go through with it is another matter. Egypt has a long list of problems of its own, including a bloody counter-terrorism campaign in Sinai that it cannot afford to lose, but also an eastern border with lawless Libya that is increasingly a new front in Cairo's fight against jihadists. It is hard to see how Egyptian General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi can commit troops to a Yemeni campaign that is not a direct threat to Egypt's security. The same kind of domestic realities, including the threat from ISIS, will also prevent Jordan from any significant contribution to Saudi military efforts in Yemen. These hard realities leave Riyadh with two options. It can look for or even mediate a political solution that will invariably include the same Houthis that Riyadh is attacking today. Alternatively, given the absence of willing states to contribute ground troops, Riyadh will have to contemplate a full-scale invasion of Yemen. That is scenario that is very hard to contemplate. The Iranians too are faced with stark choices. It is beyond Tehran's ability to tame the Yemeni crisis. As tempting as it might be for Tehran to see the Saudis bleed in Yemen, the danger of this conflict further fuelling sectarian tensions in the Middle East will undermine broader regional Iranian interests. A political compromise that both Riyadh and Tehran and their respective Yemeni allies can live with seems to be the only option that is not cataclysmic.","Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have always been thorny, but rarely has the state of affairs been as venomous as it is today .

9547,"A group of eight-year-old children in New Jersey have written letters to convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal, wishing that he will 'get better soon' while recovering in hospital from a mystery illness after being encouraged by their teacher. The cards have caused outrage and alarm among political commentators, many of whom claim the 60-year-old's illness is a fraud and clamor for attention. Abu-Jamal, who shot Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in cold blood in 1981, was taken to hospital on April 2 after collapsing in the bathroom of the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy. But this week he was delivered two batches of letters - one from a third grade class in Orange, New Jersey and another from high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union. 'Get well soon': Third graders in Orange, New Jersey, and high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union have sent Mumia Abu-Jamal letters wishing him well after he was hospitalized last week . Delivery: Johanna Fernandez (right), a professor of history at Baruch College, delivered Mumia Abu-Jamal a batch of letters from two different schools in hospital. He is pictured here also with (from left) Abdu Jon and Pam Africa . Ill: Mumia's supporters say photos of the prison journalist released this week by his wife show how ill and frail he is. Untreated diabetes is said to be the reason for Abu-Jama's hospitalization last week . The letters were delivered by Johanna Fernandez, a professor of history at Baruch College, according to Education Action Group News. 'We shared a touching moment with Mumia in an effort to raise his spirits,' Fernandez reported. 'Two teachers delivered letters to us that their students had written to Mumia.' 'It had been a long time since we had seen Mumia smile. 'He chuckled as he read excerpts from these touching letters.' The letters themselves or what they said were not released. However the fact they were written and then sent has infuriated many. Richard Costello, political coordinator for the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, said the letters set a dangerous example. 'I think its both alarming and outrageous that any teacher would use a group of innocent seven-year-olds to promote a twisted agenda glorifying murder, glorifying hatred and glorifying violence,' Costello told Fox News. 'He shot (the officer) in the back and then as the officer lay slumped against a wall helpless he leaned over and shot him between the eyes. 'When he was in the hospital he actually bragged about it.' Controversial: Marylin Zunig, a teacher at Forest Street School in Orange, New Jersey, had her third graders wrote letters to Mumia Abu-Jamal. The letters have subsequently sparked outrage . Costello said all the teachers involved in the letter writing campaign should be fired. 'Furthermore all the parents who have children in that school system need to reevaluate that involvement, because these children are now placed in danger by the very people charged with their education,' Costello said. 'They are being used as tools in someone's twisted agenda.' Costello has previously described Abu-Jamal as 'the devil'. The official reason the convicted killer was hospitalized has not been released. However reports say he was suffering high blood sugar levels. Attorney Bret Grote with the Pittsburgh-based Abolitionist Law Center said last week that his client was placed in the critical care unit of Schuylkill Medical Center in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Grote says neither he nor Abu-Jamal's brother, Keith Cook, had been allowed in to see him. 'We're concerned, about as concerned as it gets, about Mumia's health,' Grote told the Philadelphia Inquirer. Hospitalized: Convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal was placed in the critical care unit of a Pennsylvania hospital last week after collapsing in prison . A Pennsylvania Department of Corrections official also declined to provide details. A spokesman for Pottsville's Schuylkill Medical Center says he had no information about Abu-Jamal. 'We never discuss an inmate's medical condition,' deputy press secretary Susan Bensinger told the Inquirer. Mumia's hospitalization was revealed Monday when a group of his friends arrived to the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy for a visit and were informed by prison staff that he wasn't there. While Grote and others had permission with the prison to visit Mumia, the hospital had not yet cleared them. Grote said he hoped the matter would be cleared up by Tuesday. Abu-Jamal is a former Black Panther serving life in prison for the 1981 murder of white Philadelphia police Officer Daniel Faulkner. Treated: Lawyers with Pittsburgh-based Abolitionist Law Center say prison officials told them their client was being treated at Pottsville's Schuylkill Medical Center . His conviction was upheld through years of appeals, but he has gained international support for his claim that he's the victim of a racist justice system. Mumia's death sentence was overturned in 2012. Abu-Jamal supporters include celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg, and many hail him as a revolutionary. Abu-Jamal has written several books, hosted his own radio show and even has a street named after him in France.

2529,"This is the shocking moment a worker risked his life by standing on top of a house jet washing a roof with what appears to be just a rope tied around him for safety. The unnamed worker was spotted on the roof 30-feet above the ground on top of an Edwardian semi-detached home in Greenwich, south east London. A local resident noticed the man carrying out the work with a lack of safety equipment on the slippery tiles and quickly took snaps of the man. A worker who was caught jet washing the roof of a home in south east London with just a rope tied around him for safety . The neighbour said: 'I couldn't believe it. He was standing on the roof with a power washer and seemed to have a rope tied around his waist. 'It looked incredibly dangerous. His boss seemed to be watching sitting on a wall opposite and seemed unfazed by it all.' A building expert, who did not want to be named, said the workman should have at least had scaffolding up at the front of the property and a much longer ladder with a harness. He said: 'You can't just stand up there with a bit of rope tied around you and think it's fine, it's not. 'You have to think about how slippery it would be up there because as you can see he is spraying from the top to bottom, meaning the water will be trickling down around his feet. A building expert said the man should have at least had scaffolding up at the front of the property and a longer ladder . 'You would only have to slip and fall once and that would be it.' The image was then passed to the Health and Safety Executive, who attended the property and caught the man doing the same thing on the roof of the garage before he was stopped. A HSE Spokeswoman said: 'Following a concern raised, HSE inspectors visited the house yesterday and served a prohibition notice. 'This means the work had to cease until appropriate safety measures are put in place.'","The unnamed worker was spotted on the roof 30-feet above the ground on top of an Edwardian semi-detached home in Greenwich, south east London .

773,"(CNN)It's easy to be anxious about the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. After all, this is a brutal organization that not only kills but seems to revel in doing so in ways designed to shock the world -- from the beheadings of journalists to burning a Jordanian pilot alive. Such moves are part of this murky group's propaganda and its deliberate efforts to manipulate information. So what can and should we make of the organization? I explore the issue in depth in a special airing Sunday night. And although it's important to start with the caveat that ISIS is indeed trying to scare and confuse us, I took away some tentative lessons from speaking with the people who have traveled inside the minds of ISIS. First, ISIS is clearly about religion -- its version of radical Islam -- but it is also about power. There is increasing evidence that the military backbone of ISIS is made up not by a group of Islamic zealots, but rather high-ranking officers from Saddam Hussein's army -- Baathists who were at least ostensibly secular. An internal ISIS report detailing its organizational structure was reported on last week in the German weekly Der Spiegel. That report describes a group that uses its religious ideology as a recruiting and governing philosophy, much like communism. But underneath it, much like communism, is simply a drive for control, a lust for power. Next, ISIS presents itself as a global organization, but it has thrived because of a local cause. The group has gained territory, cash and recruits primarily because of the rage and rebellion of the Sunnis of Iraq and Syria, who believe they must fight the Shiites to secure their own survival and strength. The reality is that that Sunni cause is going to endure for some time. The United States has been successful in its tactical battles against ISIS and has managed to push the group back from many of its gains in Iraq. But the Sunnis of the region will remain in rebellion and the Sunni-dominated areas will remain in turmoil -- chaos that ISIS will be able to capitalize on this chaos. In the long run, ISIS might very well find that its greatest foes lie within its so-called Caliphate. The few reports that are emerging from areas controlled by ISIS suggest that, unsurprisingly, people do not like living under a brutal, theocratic dictatorship. They live in fear, and even those who chose it as an alternative to Shiite rule are growing disenchanted. In this respect, ISIS is like other radical Islamic groups, such as the Taliban -- they have an allure in the abstract, but once they are actually governing in their medieval, barbarous manner, the allure fades and the disenchantment builds. The result is ever-increasing repression. Remember, no one has ever voted ISIS into power anywhere. The group simply slaughters its way to control. Of course, one of the big questions has been: Is ISIS a threat to the West? The group's leaders declare that it is. But their ambitions appear to be mostly centered on their Arab enemies, on building a caliphate in Iraq and Syria. They understand, of course, that to be Terror Group No. 1, they must battle the country that is the world's No. 1 power -- the United States. With that in mind, they seek such a confrontation and hope that the United States will come to the Middle East and fight them on their terms, on their terrain. Still, while they are opportunists, and they ask and hope that their followers act in America, their main focus is not to come here -- they want Americans to go there. Yet no matter how one rates the level of the threat ISIS poses, the group has changed the nature of terror. The leaders of ISIS have recognized that above all, they are a messaging machine, which in turn becomes a recruitment machine. This means that the key is not what happens on the ground, but on the airwaves and in the bits and bytes of the Internet. And ISIS does this better than anyone before them because while their gruesome videos would seem a repulsive turn-off -- and are to most -- they still work on the web. The shock and awe they produce makes them go viral, and thus are seen by tens of millions. That ensures that these videos attract those utterly alienated young men -- a few thousand among the world's 1.6 billion Muslims -- who seek revenge, glory and gore. Unfortunately, as long as those young Muslim men, scattered across the globe, are attracted to ISIS and stream to its cause, the group presents the world with a danger that is impossible to fully assess but is one that grows by the month.","David Frum: ISIS is a brutal organization that not only kills but seems to revel in doing so in ways designed to shock the world .
